</ul>
<p>Learning to program involves learning not only the syntax and rules of a new language, but also a new way of thinking. Not only do we want to write code that is understandable by the computer, we must also understand what the computer will do when it tries to run that code.</p>
<p>A key part of that is learning to think like a computer thinks. We sometimes call this our &ldquo;mental model&rdquo; of a computer. If we have a good &ldquo;mental model&rdquo; of a computer, then we can learn to read code and mentally predict what it will do, even without ever running it on an actual computer. This ability is crucial for programmers to develop.</p>
<p>So, as we work through this lab, we&rsquo;ll need to constantly pay attention to how a real computer works, and make sure that our &ldquo;mental model&rdquo; is accurate. If not, we&rsquo;ll have to adapt our understanding of a computer to match the real world. This process of adaptation and accommodation is an important part of learning to program - we have to have a good understanding of what a computer actually does when it runs our code, or else we won&rsquo;t be able to write code that will do what we want it to do.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve chosen Python because it is very easy to learn, easy to use, and it is used in many different places, from scientific computing and data analysis to web servers and even artificial intelligence. It is a very useful language to learn, and it makes a great first programming language.</p>
<p>As we learn to write code in a real programming language, it helps to refer to the actual documentation from time to time. So, we recommend bookmarking the official 

<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python Documentation</a> as a great place to start. Throughout this course, we may also include links to additional resources, and those are also worth bookmarking. One of the best parts about programming is that nearly all of the documentation is online and easily accessible, and learning how to quickly search for a particular solution or reference is just as useful as knowing how to do it from memory. In fact, most programmers really only know the basics of the language and a few handy tricks, and the rest of it is just reading documentation and learning when to use it. So, don&rsquo;t worry about remembering it all right from the start - instead, learn to read the documentation and use the tools that are available, and focus on understanding the basics of the language&rsquo;s syntax and rules. Let&rsquo;s get started!</p>

<h1>Working in the Terminal</h1>

</ul>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s start with the basics of writing Python code in a file and running those files. This is the first major step toward actually writing a real program, but it can definitely be difficult the first time without prior experience to rely on. So, let&rsquo;s go through it step by step and make sure we know how to run our programs in Python.</p>
<p>At this point, we should already have Python installed on our system. For students using Codio, this is taken care of already. For students using their own computers, refer to an earlier lab to find instructions for installing Python on your system, or contact the instructors for assistance.</p>
<p>To make sure that Python is installed and working, we&rsquo;ll need to open a terminal in our operating system. In Codio, this can be found by clicking the <strong>Tools</strong> menu at the top, and then choosing <strong>Terminal</strong>. More information can be found in the 

<a href="https://docs.codio.com/develop/develop/ide/boxes/terminal.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Codio Documentation</a>. There may also already be one open for you if you are reading this content from within Codio.</p>
<p>If you are working on your own computer, you&rsquo;ll need to open a terminal on your operating system. This should have been covered in the previous lab when you installed Python. On Windows, look for <strong>Windows Terminal</strong> or <strong>Windows PowerShell</strong> (not the old Command Prompt, which requires different commands). On Mac or Linux, look for an application called <strong>Terminal</strong>. Throughout this course, we&rsquo;ll call these windows the <strong>terminal</strong>, even though they may have slightly different names in each operating system.</p>
<p>Once we have the terminal open, we should see something like one of these examples:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/01/terminal_linux.png" alt="Linux Terminal"></p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/01/terminal_win.png" alt="Windows Terminal"></p>
<p>At this point, we should see a place with a blinking cursor, where we can type our commands. This is called the <strong>command prompt</strong> in the terminal. The first thing we can do is check to make sure Python is properly installed, and we can also confirm that it is the correct version. To do this, we&rsquo;ll enter the following command and press enter to execute it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>python3 --version
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Hopefully, that command should produce some output that looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/01/python_version.png" alt="Python Version"></p>
<p>Here, we see that the currently installed Python version is 3.10.6. As long as your Python version number begins with a 3, you have correctly installed Python and are able to run it from the terminal. So, we can continue to the next part of this lab.</p>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t able to run Python or aren&rsquo;t sure that you have the correct version, contact the instructor for assistance!</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Python 2 vs. Python 3</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>Notice that we have to use the command <code>python3</code>, including the version number, instead of the simpler <code>python</code> command here. This is because some systems may also have Python version 2, an outdated version of Python, installed alongside version 3. In that case, the simple <code>python</code> command will be Python version 2, while <code>python3</code> will be Python version 3. Unfortunately, most programs written in Python 3 will not run properly in Python 2, so it is important for us to make sure we are using the correct Python version when running our programs.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the command <code>python3</code> should always work, and using that command is a good habit to learn. So, throughout this course, we will use the command <code>python3</code> to run Python programs.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<h2 id="navigating-in-the-terminal">Navigating in the Terminal</h2>
<p>When we open a terminal, it will usually start in our user&rsquo;s home folder. This may mean different locations for different operating systems. For example, if our current user&rsquo;s name is <code>&lt;username&gt;</code>, the terminal will usually start in this location for each operating system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows</strong>: <code>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;</code></li>
<li><strong>Linux</strong>: <code>/home/&lt;username&gt;</code></li>
<li><strong>Mac</strong>: <code>/Users/&lt;username&gt;</code></li>
<li><strong>Codio</strong>: <code>/home/codio/workspace</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The directory that is open in the terminal is known as the <strong>working directory</strong>. We can use the <code>pwd</code> command to determine what our current directory is:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/01/pwd.png" alt="Print Working Directory"></p>
<p>In this example, we are looking at the Codio terminal, so our working directory is <code>/home/codio/workspace</code>.</p>
<p>Next, we can see the files and directories contained in that directory using the <code>ls</code> command. Here&rsquo;s the output of running this command in Codio:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/01/ls.png" alt="List Directory Command"></p>
<p>In the output, we can see that there is a file named <code>README.txt</code> and a directory named <code>python</code>. In Codio, we&rsquo;ll place all of our files in the <code>python</code> directory, so we can open that using the <code>cd python</code> command:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/01/cd.png" alt="Change Directory Command"></p>
<p>Notice how the <code>python</code> directory is now included in the command prompt in the terminal. Most terminals will show the working directory in the command prompt in some way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the basics of navigating in the terminal, but there is much more to learn. If you&rsquo;d like to know more, consider checking out some of the resources linked below!</p>

    <div class="box-content">
<p>Most of the content in this course will focus on using the commands that are present in the Linux terminal, since they are the most widely-used commands across all platforms. In general, these commands should work well on both Windows and Mac, with a few caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>On Windows, there is an older Command Prompt tool that does not support the newer Linux commands. Therefore, we won&rsquo;t be using it. Instead, we only want to use <strong>Windows PowerShell</strong>, which supports most of the basic Linux commands via aliases to similar PowerShell commands. We can also install the 

<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Windows Terminal</a> application for a more modern interface.</li>
<li>Windows users may also choose to install the 

<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)</a> to run Linux (such as Ubuntu) directly within Windows. Many developers choose to pursue this option, as it provides a clean and easy to use development environment that is compatible with the Linux operating system.</li>
<li>The Mac operating system includes a terminal that uses either ZSH (since OS X 10.15) or Bash (OS X 10.14 and below). This terminal is very similar to the Linux terminal when it comes to navigating the file system and executing programs, which is sufficient for this course.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fully learning how to use these tools is outside of the scope of this class, but we need to know enough to navigate the filesystem and execute the <code>python3</code> command. If you need assistance getting started with this step, your best bet is to contact the instructors. Each student&rsquo;s computer is a bit different, so it is difficult to cover all possible cases here.</p>

<h1>Print Statement</h1>
<!-- EAV raw complete -->
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yveXTTVXzZ0">YouTube Video</a></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/01-basic-python/03-print-statement/slides/" target="_blank">Slides</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Before we learn to write our first program, let&rsquo;s start by introducing some important vocabulary terms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>string</strong>: A <strong>string</strong> in programming is any text that is stored as a value. We typically represent strings by placing them inside double quotes <code>&quot;&quot;</code> in our code and elsewhere.</li>
<li><strong>value</strong>: A <strong>value</strong> is a piece of data that our program is storing and manipulating. In our pseudocode, values consist of either numbers or strings.</li>
<li><strong>keyword</strong>: A <strong>keyword</strong> is a reserved word in a programming language that defines a particular statement, expression, structure, or other use. As we&rsquo;ll learn later, we cannot use these keywords as variable or procedure names.</li>
<li><strong>statement</strong>: A <strong>statement</strong> refers to a piece of code that performs an action, but doesn&rsquo;t result in any value. Most complete lines of code are considered statements.</li>
<li><strong>expression</strong>: An <strong>expression</strong>, on the other hand, is a piece of code that, when evaluated, will result in a value that can be used or stored. An expression can even contain multiple expressions inside of it!</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;ll use these terms to help us understand different parts of the code in our programs. Now that we&rsquo;ve covered them them, we can start to discuss the various statements in Python.</p>
<p>The first statement that we&rsquo;ll cover in the Python programming language is the <code>print(expression)</code> statement. This statement is used to display output to the user via the terminal. So, when Python runs this statement, it will evaluate the <code>expression</code> to a single value, and then print that value to the terminal.</p>
<p>For example, the simplest Python code would be a simple Hello World program, where we use the <code>print(expression)</code> statement to display the text <code>&quot;Hello World&quot;</code> to the user:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hello World&#34;</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Notice that the <code>expression</code> part of the statement contains <code>&quot;Hello World&quot;</code> in quotation marks? That is because <code>&quot;Hello World&quot;</code> is text, so we should put it in quotes and make it into a string in our code. Also, since the string <code>&quot;Hello World&quot;</code> can be treated like a value, we can also say it is an expression, and therefore we can use it in the <code>expression</code> part of the statement. This may seem pretty straightforward now, but as our programs become more complex it is important to think about what pieces of code can be treated as values, expressions, and statements.</p>
<p>When we run that program in Python, we&rsquo;ll see the following output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>Hello World
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If you look at the output, you might notice something strange - the text on our user interface doesn&rsquo;t include the quotation marks <code>&quot;&quot;</code> that the expression <code>&quot;Hello World&quot;</code> contained. When we display text to the user, Python will remove the quotation marks from the beginning and the end of the string, and just display the text inside. Pretty handy!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go through the full process of writing and running that program in Python!</p>
<h2 id="writing-a-python-program">Writing a Python Program</h2>
<p>The first step to create a program in Python is to create a text file to store the code. This file should have the file extension <code>.py</code> to indicate that it is a Python program. So, we&rsquo;ll need to create that file either on our computers or in Codio or another tool if we are using one. For example, in Codio we can create the file in the <code>python</code> folder by right-clicking on it and selecting the <strong>New File</strong> option. We&rsquo;ll name the file <code>hello.py</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/01/new_file.png" alt="New File"></p>
<p>Once we&rsquo;ve created that file, we can then open it by clicking on it. In Codio and in other online tools, it will open in the built-in editor. On a computer, we&rsquo;ll need to open it in a text editor specifically designed for programming. We recommend  

<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visual Studio Code</a>, which is available on all platforms. Tools like the built-in Notepad tool on Windows, or a word processor like Word or Pages do not work for this task.</p>
<p>In that file, we&rsquo;ll simply place the code shown above, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/01/code.png" alt="Code"></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all there is to it!</p>
<h2 id="running-a-python-program">Running a Python Program</h2>
<p>Once we&rsquo;ve written the code, we can open the <strong>Terminal</strong> and navigate to where the code is stored in order to run the program. On Codio, we&rsquo;ll just use the <code>cd python</code> command to enter the <code>python</code> directory. On a computer, we&rsquo;ll need to navigate the file system to find the location where we placed our code. We highly recommend creating a folder directly within the home directory and placing all of our code there - that will make it easy to find!</p>
<p>Once we are in the correct directory, we can use the <code>ls</code> command to see the contents of that directory. If we see our <code>hello.py</code> file, we are in the correct location:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/01/file.png" alt="Show Python File"></p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t see our file, we should make sure we&rsquo;ve saved it and that our current working directory is the same location as where the file is stored.</p>
<p>Finally, we can execute the file in Python using the <code>python3</code> command, followed by the name of the file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>python3 hello.py
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If everything works correctly, we should see output similar to this:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/01/hello.png" alt="Hello World Output"></p>
<p>There we go! We&rsquo;ve just run our first program in Python! That&rsquo;s a great first step to take.</p>
<p>Of course, there are lots of ways that this could go wrong. So, if you run into any issues getting this to work, please take the time to contact an instructor and ask for assistance. This process can be daunting the first time, since there are so many things to learn and so many intricacies we simply don&rsquo;t have time to cover up front. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask for help!</p>

</ul>
<p>One important key to remember: by default, the <code>print(expression)</code> statement in Python will add a newline to the end of the output by default. This means that multiple <code>print(expression)</code> statements will print on multiple lines. Let&rsquo;s look at some examples!</p>
<p>Throughout this course, we&rsquo;ll show many different code examples and their output here in the lab. To test them out, feel free to copy the code examples to a Python file and run it yourself. You can even tweak them to do something new and see how Python interprets different pieces of code. In the end, the best way to learn programming is to explore, and running these examples on your own is a great way to get started!</p>
<h2 id="example-1---multiple-statements">Example 1 - Multiple Statements</h2>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s write a simple program that prints 4 letters separated by spaces:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;a b c d&#34;</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Just like our &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; program, when we run this program, we&rsquo;ll see that string printed in the user interface:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>a b c d
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Ok, that makes sense based on what we&rsquo;ve previously seen. The <code>print(expression)</code> statement will simply display any string expression in our user interface.</p>
<p>Of course, programs can consist of multiple statements or lines of code. So, what if we write a program that contains multiple <code>print(expression)</code> statements, like this one:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;one&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;two&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;three&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;four&#34;</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>What do you think will happen when we try to execute this program on our &ldquo;mental model?&rdquo; Have we learned a rule that tells us what should happen yet? Recall on the previous page we learned that it will print the value on the user interface, but that&rsquo;s it. So, when we execute this program, we&rsquo;ll see the following output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>one
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>two
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>three
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>four
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>That&rsquo;s a very interesting result! We can see that four separate <code>print(expression)</code> statements will generate four lines of output by default. Each statement is printed on its own line. So, in Python we can print multiple lines of output simply by using multiple <code>print(expression)</code> statements!</p>
<h2 id="example-2---multiple-lines-from-single-statement">Example 2 - Multiple Lines from Single Statement</h2>
<p>What if we want to print output on multiple lines using a single <code>print(expression)</code> statement? How can we do that? In this case, we need to introduce a special symbol, the <strong>newline</strong> symbol. In most programming languages, the newline symbol is represented by a backslash followed by the letter &ldquo;n&rdquo;, like <code>\n</code>, in a string. When our user interface sees a newline symbol, it will move to the next line before printing the rest of the string. The newline symbol itself won&rsquo;t appear in our output.</p>
<p>For example, we can update our previous program to contain newline symbols between each letter:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;a</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">\n</span><span style="color:#e6db74">b</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">\n</span><span style="color:#e6db74">c</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">\n</span><span style="color:#e6db74">d&#34;</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This might be a bit difficult to read at first, but as we become more and more familiar with reading code, we&rsquo;ll start to see special symbols like the newline symbol just like any other letter. For now, we&rsquo;ll just have to read closely and make sure we are on the lookout for special symbols in our text.</p>
<p>When we run this program, we should see the following output on our user interface:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>a
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>b
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>c
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>d
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>There we go! We&rsquo;ve now figured out how to print text on multiple lines using a single <code>print(expression)</code> statement.</p>
<h2 id="example-3---multiple-statements-on-same-line">Example 3 - Multiple Statements on Same Line</h2>
<p>What if we want to display multiple <code>print(expression)</code> statements on the same line? To do that, we must add an additional option to the <code>print(expression)</code> statement - the <code>end</code> option.</p>
<p>For example, the following code will produce output all on the same line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hello &#34;</span>, end<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;World!&#34;</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this example, we set <code>end</code> to be an empty string <code>&quot;&quot;</code>. When we run this program, we&rsquo;ll get the following output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>Hello World!
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In fact, in Python, the <code>print(expression)</code> statement is an example of a <strong>function</strong> in Python. <strong>Functions</strong> are just repeatable procedures in our code - when we use them, we write the name of the function, followed by a set of parentheses and then inputs, or &ldquo;arguments,&rdquo; separated by commas within the parentheses. This is known as &ldquo;calling&rdquo; a function. So, in actuality, the <code>expression</code> in the <code>print(expression)</code> statement is just the first argument when we call the <code>print</code> function.</p>
<p>Therefore, the <code>end</code> option that we showed above is just a second argument that is optional - it simply lets us choose what to put at the end of the output. By default, the <code>end</code> parameter is set to the newline symbol <code>\n</code>, so if we don&rsquo;t provide an argument for <code>end</code> it will just add a newline at the end of the value.</p>
<p>We can set the value of <code>end</code> to be any string. If we want to include a space at the end of the output, we can add <code>end=&quot; &quot;</code> to the <code>print</code> function call.</p>
<p>In this course, we won&rsquo;t spend much time talking about optional parameters and default values in Python functions, but it is important to understand that statements like <code>print</code> are actually just Python functions behind the scenes!</p>

<h1>Variables</h1>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/01-basic-python/06-variables/slides/" target="_blank">Slides</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve learned how to use the <code>print(expression)</code> statement, let&rsquo;s focus on the next major concept in Python, as well as any other programming language: <strong>variables</strong>.</p>
<p>The word <strong>variable</strong> is traditionally defined as a value that can change. We&rsquo;ve seen variables like $x$ used in Algebraic equations like $x + 4 = 7$ to represent unknown values that we can try to work out. In programming a <strong>variable</strong> is defined as a way to store a value in a computer&rsquo;s memory so we can retrieve it later. One common way to think of variables is like a box in the real world. We can put something in the box, representing our value. Likewise, we can write a name on the side of the box, corresponding to our variable&rsquo;s name. When we want to use the variable, we can get the value that it currently stores, and even change it to a different value. It&rsquo;s a pretty handy mental metaphor to keep in mind!</p>
<p>In a later lab, we&rsquo;ll learn how to use operators to manipulate the values stored in variables, but for right now we&rsquo;re just going to focus on storing and retrieving data using variables.</p>
<h2 id="creating-variables">Creating Variables</h2>
<p>To use a variable, we must first create one. In Python, we create a variable in a special type of statement called an <strong>assignment statement</strong>. The basic structure for an assignment statement is <code>a = expression</code>. When our Python interpreter runs this statement, it will first evaluate <code>expression</code> into a single value. Then, it will store that value in the variable named <code>a</code>.</p>
<p>For example, let&rsquo;s consider the Python statement:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hello World&#34;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In that statement, we are storing the string value <code>&quot;Hello World&quot;</code> in the variable named <code>x</code>. Pretty handy!</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s cover some important rules related to assignment statements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Assignment statements are always written with the variable on the left, and an expression on the right. We cannot reverse the statement and say <code>expression = x</code> in programming like we can in math. In mathematical terms, this means an assignment statement is not commutative.</li>
<li>The left side of an assignment statement must be a location where a value can be stored. For now, we&rsquo;re just going to work with single variables, so we don&rsquo;t have to worry about this yet. In a later lab, we&rsquo;ll introduce lists as another way to store data, and we&rsquo;ll revisit this rule.</li>
<li>The right side of an assignment statement must be an expression that evaluates to a value that can be stored in the location given on the left side. Right now we&rsquo;re only working with string values, so we don&rsquo;t have to worry about this rule yet. We&rsquo;ll come back to it in a future lab.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="using-variables">Using Variables</h2>
<p>Once we&rsquo;ve created a variable, we can use it in any <strong>expression</strong> to recall the current value stored in the variable. So, we can extend our previous example to store a value in a variable, and then use the <code>print(expression)</code> statement to display it&rsquo;s value. Here&rsquo;s what that would look like in Python:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hello World&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(x)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Notice that we don&rsquo;t put quotation marks <code>&quot;</code> around the variable <code>x</code> in the <code>print(expression)</code> statement. This is because we want to display the value stored in the variable <code>x</code>, not the string value <code>&quot;x&quot;</code>. So, when we run this code, we should get this output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>Hello World
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>To confirm, feel free to try it yourself! Copy the code above into a Python file, then use the <code>python3</code> command in the terminal to run the file and see what it does. Running these examples is a great way to learn how a computer actually executes code, and it helps to confirm that your &ldquo;mental model&rdquo; of a computer matches how a real computer operates.</p>
<h2 id="updating-variable-values">Updating Variable Values</h2>
<p>Python also allows us to change the value stored in a variable using another <strong>assignment statement</strong>. For example, we can write some Python code that uses the same variable to print multiple outputs:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>a <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Output 1&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(a)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>a <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Output 2&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(a)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When we run this code, we&rsquo;ll see the following output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>Output 1
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Ouptut 2
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So, just like we learned above, when we evaluate a variable in code, it will result in the value currently stored in that variable at the time it is evaluated. So, even though we are printing the same variable twice, each time it is storing a different value. Recall that this is why we call items like <code>a</code> a <strong>variable</strong> - their value can change!</p>
<h2 id="variable-names">Variable Names</h2>
<p>Finally, Python has a few simple rules that determine what names can be used for variables in our code. Let&rsquo;s quickly review those rules, as well as some conventions that most Python developers follow when naming variables.</p>
<p>First, the <strong>rules</strong> that must be followed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Variable names must begin with either a letter or an underscore <code>_</code>.</li>
<li>Variable names may only contain letters, numbers, and underscores <code>_</code>.</li>
<li>Variable names are case sensitive.</li>
</ol>
<p>Next, here are the <strong>conventions</strong> that most Python developers follow for variable names, which we will also follow in this course:</p>
<ol>
<li>Variable names beginning with an underscore <code>_</code> have a special meaning. So, we won&rsquo;t create any variables beginning with an underscore right now, but later we&rsquo;ll learn about what they mean and start using them.</li>
<li>Variables should have a descriptive name, like total or average, that makes it clear what the variable is used for.</li>
<li>Variables should be named using 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Snake Case</a>. This means that spaces are represented by underscores <code>_</code>, as in <code>number_of_inputs</code></li>
<li>Try to use traditional variable names only for their specific uses. Some examples of traditional variable names:
<ol>
<li><code>tmp</code> or <code>temp</code> are temporary variables.</li>
<li><code>i</code>, <code>j</code>, and <code>k</code> are iterator variables (we&rsquo;ll learn about those later).</li>
<li><code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code> are coordinates in a coordinate plane.</li>
<li><code>r</code>, <code>g</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>a</code> are colors in an RGB color system.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Variables should not have the same name as keywords or any built-in statements or expressions in the language.
<ol>
<li>For example, Python has a <code>print</code> statement, so we should not name a variable <code>print</code> in our language.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>In general, longer variable names are more useful than short ones, even if they are more difficult to type.</li>
</ol>
<p>These conventions are not strict requirements enforced by the Python language itself, but they are general rules to help us write code that is meaningful and easy to read.</p>
<p>Finally, don&rsquo;t forget that some of the code examples in this course will <strong>NOT</strong> follow these conventions, mainly because long, descriptive variable names might give away the purpose of the code itself. We&rsquo;ll still follow the <strong>rules</strong> that are required, but in many cases we&rsquo;ll use simple variable names so that the focus is learning to read the structure of the code, not inferring what it does based solely on the names of the variables.</p>

<p>As we learn to write more complex programs in Python, it is important to make sure we can still mentally execute the code we are writing in our &ldquo;mental model&rdquo; of a computer before we actually run it on a computer. After all, if we don&rsquo;t have at least an idea of what the code actually does before we write it, we really haven&rsquo;t learned much about programming!</p>
<p>Thankfully, when working in a real programming language such as Python, there are many tools to help us visualize how the code works when we run it. This helps us continue to develop our &ldquo;mental model&rdquo; of a computer by looking behind the scenes a bit to see what is happening when we run our code.</p>
<p>One such tool is 

<a href="https://pythontutor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python Tutor</a>, a website that can quickly run short pieces of Python code to help us visualize what each line does and how it works. This tool is also integrated directly into Codio!</p>
<h2 id="python-tutor-example">Python Tutor Example</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at an example of how Python Tutor compares to the manual code traces we performed in a previous lab. For this example, we&rsquo;re going to use the following code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hello&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> x
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(y, end<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34; &#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;World&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(x, end<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;, &#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(y)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This visualization can be found by clicking this 

<a href="https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#code=x%20%3D%20%22Hello%22%0Ay%20%3D%20x%0Aprint%28y,%20end%3D%22%20%22%29%0Ax%20%3D%20%22World%22%0Aprint%28x,%20end%3D%22,%20%22%29%0Aprint%28y%29&amp;cumulative=false&amp;heapPrimitives=nevernest&amp;mode=edit&amp;origin=opt-frontend.js&amp;py=3&amp;rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&amp;textReferences=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python Tutor Link</a> to open Python Tutor on the web.</p>
<h2 id="stepping-through-code">Stepping Through Code</h2>
<p>The initial setup for Python Tutor is shown in the image below:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/01/tutor1.png" alt="Python Tutor 1"></p>
<p>This looks similar to the setup we used when performing code tracing with pseudocode. We have an arrow next to our code that is keeping track of the next line to be executed, and we have areas to the side to record variables and outputs. In Python Tutor, the variables are stored in the <strong>Frames</strong> section. We&rsquo;ll learn why that is important later in this lab when we start looking at Python functions.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s click the <strong>Next &gt;</strong> button once to execute the first line of code. After we do that, we should see the following setup in Python Tutor:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/01/tutor2.png" alt="Python Tutor 2"></p>
<p>That line is an <strong>assignment statement</strong>, so Python Tutor added an entry in the <strong>Frames</strong> section for the variable <code>x</code>, showing that it now contains the string value <code>&quot;Hello&quot;</code>. It placed that variable in a frame it is calling the &ldquo;Global frame,&rdquo; which simply contains variables that are created outside of a function in Python.</p>
<p>When we click the <strong>Next &gt;</strong> button again, we should see this:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/01/tutor3.png" alt="Python Tutor 3"></p>
<p>Once again, the line that was just executed is an assignment statement, so Python Tutor will add a new variable entry for <code>y</code> to the list of variables. It will also store the string value <code>&quot;Hello&quot;</code>. Just like before, notice that the variable <code>y</code> is storing the same value as <code>x</code>, but it is a <em>copy</em> of that value. The variables are not connected in any other way.</p>
<p>We can click <strong>Next &gt;</strong> again to execute the next line of code:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/01/tutor4.png" alt="Python Tutor 4"></p>
<p>Once this line is executed, we&rsquo;ll see that it prints the value of the variable <code>y</code> to the output. Python Tutor will look up the value of <code>y</code> in the <strong>Frames</strong> section and print it in the output, but it won&rsquo;t evaluate the expression in the code like we did when we performed code tracing in pseudocode. It&rsquo;s a subtle difference, but it is worth noting.</p>
<p>Once again, we can click <strong>Next &gt;</strong> to execute the next assignment statement:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/01/tutor5.png" alt="Python Tutor 5"></p>
<p>This statement will update the value stored in the variable <code>x</code> to be the string value <code>&quot;World&quot;</code>. After that, we can run the next statement:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/01/tutor6.png" alt="Python Tutor 6"></p>
<p>That statement prints the value of <code>x</code> to the output, followed by a comma <code>,</code> and a space as shown in the <code>end</code> argument provided to the <code>print</code> function. Finally, we can click <strong>Next &gt;</strong> one more time to execute the last line of code:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/01/tutor7.png" alt="Python Tutor 7"></p>
<p>This will print the value of <code>y</code> to the output. Once the entire program has been executed, we should see the output <code>Hello World, Hello</code> printed to the screen.</p>
<p>The full process is shown in the animation below:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/01/tutor.gif" alt="Python Tutor"></p>
<p>Using tools like Python Tutor to step through small pieces of code and understand how the computer interprets them is a very helpful way to make sure our &ldquo;mental model&rdquo; of a computer accurately reflects what is going on behind the scenes when we run a piece of Python code on a real computer. So, as we continue to show and discuss examples in this course, feel free to use tools such as Python Tutor, as well as just running the code yourself, as a great way to make sure you understand what the code is actually doing.</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2 id="python">Python</h2>
<p>We introduced some basic statements and structures in the Python programming language. Let&rsquo;s quickly review them!</p>
<h3 id="print-statement">Print Statement</h3>
<p>The <code>print(expression)</code> statement is used to print output on the terminal.</p>
<ol>
<li>It will evaluate <code>expression</code> to a value, then display it to the screen.</li>
<li>By default, it will add a newline to the end of the output.</li>
<li>We can change that using the <code>end</code> parameter, such as <code>print(expression, end=&quot;&quot;)</code> to remove the newline.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="assignment-statement">Assignment Statement</h3>
<p>The assignment statement, like <code>a = expression</code> is used to create variables and store values in the variables.</p>
<ol>
<li>The variable must be on the left side, and the right side must be an expression that evaluates to a single value.</li>
<li>If the variable does not exist, it is created. Otherwise, the current value of the variable is replaced by the new value.</li>
<li>Variable names must begin with a letter or underscore, and may only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.</li>
<li>Variable names beginning with an underscore have a special meaning, so we won&rsquo;t use them right now.</li>
</ol>

<p>So far, we&rsquo;ve only worked with <strong>string</strong> values in Python. Strings are a very useful <strong>data type</strong> in programming languages such as Python, but they are very limited in their use. Recall that a <strong>data type</strong> simply defines how a particular value is stored in a computer. The <strong><code>str</code></strong> data type is used to store string values in Python.</p>
<p>Python supports many different data types for handling various data that we&rsquo;d like to store and manipulate in our programs. In this lab, we&rsquo;re going to cover the two basic types used for storing numbers in Python, the <strong><code>int</code></strong> or integer type, and the <strong><code>float</code></strong> or floating-point type.</p>
<h2 id="integers">Integers</h2>
<p>In mathematics, an <strong>integer</strong> is a whole number, such as 
<span class="math align-center">$ 3 $</span>, 
<span class="math align-center">$ -5 $</span>, or even 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span>. Basically, any positive or negative number that doesn&rsquo;t include a fractional or decimal portion is a whole number, and therefore it is an <strong>integer</strong>. In Python, those numbers can be stored in the <strong><code>int</code></strong> data type.</p>
<p>In Python, we can store an integer value in a variable using an assignment statement:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>That statement will store the integer value 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span> in the variable <code>x</code>. Notice that the value 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span> does not have quotation marks around it. This is because we want to store the integer value 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span> and not the string value <code>&quot;5&quot;</code> in the variable. Also, as we learned earlier, this is why we cannot create variable names that begin with a number - since numerical values start with a number, this is how Python can tell the difference between a numerical value and a variable.</p>
<p>We can also store negative numbers in a variable by placing a negative symbol <code>-</code> in front of the numerical value:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#f92672">-</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">8</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We&rsquo;ll need to be careful and make sure that there is a space after the equals sign <code>=</code>, but no space between the negative symbol <code>-</code> and the number after it. Otherwise, the negative symbol could be confused for the minus symbol, which is an operator that we&rsquo;ll learn about later in this lab.</p>
<p>In Python, there is effectively no maximum size for an integer, so we can store any arbitrarily large whole number (either positive or negative) in an <code>int</code> variable.</p>

<h1>Floats</h1>

</ul>
<p>The other type of number we can store in Python is a <strong>floating-point</strong> number. We won&rsquo;t go into too much detail about floating-point values here, since you&rsquo;ll learn about them elsewhere in this class. For the purposes of programming, the only thing to know about floating-point numbers is that they are used to represent numbers that include a fractional or decimal portion. In Python, these values are stored in the <strong><code>float</code></strong> data type.</p>
<p>To create a variable that stores a floating-point value in Python, we can use an assignment statement that includes a value with a decimal point, like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>a <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5.8</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We can also create negative values using the negative symbol <code>-</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>b <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#f92672">-</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">7.987</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Finally, it is possible to store a whole number in a floating-point value by simply adding a decimal point and a <code>0</code> at the end of the value, as in this example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>c <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">42.0</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Later in this lab, we&rsquo;ll see a couple of situations where that may be useful.</p>
<p>For now, we&rsquo;re just going to assume that Python can easily handle any reasonable number we want it to store in a <code>float</code> variable, but there are some limits to the size and accuracy of those numbers. To reach these limits, we usually have to be dealing with numbers that have 
<span class="math align-center">$ 100 $</span> or more digits, either before or after the decimal place. So, for the purposes of this class, those limits really won&rsquo;t apply to what we&rsquo;re doing. You&rsquo;ll learn about these limits in detail in later programming classes.</p>

<h2 id="determining-variable-type">Determining Variable Type</h2>
<p>One thing that is very useful to know how to do in Python is determining the type of data stored in a variable. Python is very flexible, and we can store any type of data in any variable. In fact, a variable&rsquo;s data type can even change in Python, which is something that many other programming languages won&rsquo;t allow. Technically speaking, we would say that Python uses <strong>strong typing</strong>, which means that each variable has a known data type that we can find, and <strong>dynamic typing</strong>, meaning that the type of the variable can change while the program is running.</p>
<p>To determine the type of a variable, we can use the <code>type(expression)</code> function in Python. We can simply place any variable or expression in the <code>expression</code> argument, and then it will tell us the type of the value that results from evaluating that expression. Then, we can simply use the <code>print()</code> function to print it to the screen. We won&rsquo;t use this in our programs themselves, but it can be helpful for debugging purposes or to just better understand what is going on with data types.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick example program showing the <code>type()</code> function in Python:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hello&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>z <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">6.7</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(type(x))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(type(y))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(type(z))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When we execute this code in Python, we should see the following output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;class &#39;float&#39;&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Based on that output, we can assume that the variable <code>x</code> is the <code>str</code> data type for strings, <code>y</code> is the <code>int</code> data type for whole numbers, and <code>z</code> is the <code>float</code> data type for decimal numbers. The <code>type()</code> function is pretty handy!</p>
<h2 id="converting-between-data-types">Converting Between Data Types</h2>
<p>We can also convert values between the various data types in Python. To do this, there are special functions that match the name of the data types themselves. So, to convert any value to a string, we can use the <code>str()</code> function. Likewise, to convert anything to an integer, we can use the <code>int()</code> function. And finally, to convert anything to a floating-point value, we can use the <code>float()</code> function.</p>
<p>So, we can extend the previous example a bit by showing how we can convert values between different data types:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;5.7&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(x)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(type(x))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print()
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> float(x)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(y)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(type(y))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print()
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>z <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> int(y)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(z)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(type(z))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When we run this program, we&rsquo;ll get this output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>5.7
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>5.7
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;class &#39;float&#39;&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>5
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this program, we&rsquo;re starting with the string value <code>&quot;5.7&quot;</code> stored in variable <code>x</code>. So, the first two <code>print()</code> statements will print that string value, and show that <code>x</code> is indeed storing a <code>str</code> data type. Then, we&rsquo;ll use the <code>float()</code> function to convert the string value <code>&quot;5.7&quot;</code> stored in <code>x</code> to the floating-point value 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5.7 $</span> and store that in <code>y</code>. The next two print statements will print that value, and show that <code>y</code> is storing a <code>float</code> data type. Notice that the value printed for both variables <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> looks identical, but the data type of each variable is different!</p>
<p>Finally, we can use the <code>int()</code> function to convert the floating-point value 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5.7 $</span> to an integer. In math, when we are asked to convert the number 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5.7 $</span> to a whole number, our first instinct is probably to just round up to 
<span class="math align-center">$ 6 $</span>, since that is the closest value. However, in Python, as in most other programming languages, this function will simply <strong>truncate</strong> the value instead. <strong>Truncating</strong> a value simply means we take off the end of the value, so to convert 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5.7 $</span> to an integer we just remove the decimal portion, and we&rsquo;re left with the value 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span>. So, in the output above, we see that <code>z</code> stores the integer value 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span>, and it is the <code>int</code> data type.</p>
<p>Notice that we are careful to say that the <code>int()</code> function will <strong>truncate</strong> the value, and not that it will round down. This is due to how Python handles negative numbers like 
<span class="math align-center">$ -5.7 $</span>. When converting that to an integer, it will also truncate it to 
<span class="math align-center">$ -5 $</span> instead of rounding down to 
<span class="math align-center">$ -6 $</span>. So, we use the word <strong>truncate</strong> as the best way to describe the <code>int()</code> function.</p>
<h2 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h2>
<p>Since we are running our Python programs on a real computer, we have to be a bit careful about how we use these functions. Specifically, if we try to convert a value to a different data type and Python can&rsquo;t figure out how to do that, we&rsquo;ll cause an <strong>exception</strong> to occur. An <strong>exception</strong> in programming is any error that happens when the computer tries to run our code.</p>
<p>For example, what if we try to convert the string value <code>&quot;5.7&quot;</code> directly to an <code>int</code> data type, as in this example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>a <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;5.7&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(a)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(type(a))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print()
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>b <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> int(a)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(b)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(type(b))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When we try to run this code in a file, such as the <code>tutor.py</code> file shown here, we&rsquo;ll see this output printed on the terminal:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>5.7
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Traceback (most recent call last):
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  File &#34;tutor.py&#34;, line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    b = int(a)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: &#39;5.7&#39;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Uh oh! That&rsquo;s not good. In the output, we can see that we&rsquo;ve caused a <code>ValueError</code>, which is an exception that happens when we try to use a value in an incorrect way. So, we&rsquo;ll need to carefully look at our code to see if we can find and fix the error.</p>
<p>Thankfully, in the output, it will tell us that the error occurred on line 5 of the file <code>tutor.py</code>, so we can open that file and scroll to that line of code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>b <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> int(a)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is where the error occurred. There are several ways we can fix it. The easiest would be to simply convert <code>a</code> to a floating-point value using the <code>float()</code> function instead.</p>
<p>Learning how to find and fix these exceptions is a key part of learning how to program. We&rsquo;ll inevitably run into a few exceptions as we start to build larger and more complex programs. In this course, most exceptions can be easily handled simply by working carefully through the code, but every once in a while we may run into an exception that is truly difficult to solve. That&rsquo;s one of the important things to remember when learning how to program - it is sometimes much easier to cause an exception than it is to figure out how to fix it, and sometimes you may need to reach out for help to get past a particularly tricky exception. So, don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask the instructors or TAs for help if you get stuck on an exception. Many times, it&rsquo;s a great chance for you to learn some new programming skills.</p>

<h1>Basic Operators</h1>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/02-numbers/04-basic-operators/slides/" target="_blank">Slides</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we have the ability to store numerical data in variables in Python, we should also learn how to manipulate that data into something new. To do that, let&rsquo;s learn about <strong>operators</strong>. An <strong>operator</strong> in programming is a special symbol that can be used in an expression to manipulate the data in some way.</p>
<p>Most operators are <strong>binary operators</strong>, which means they perform an operation that uses two values as input and produces a single value as output. In fact, in some programming languages, the operators themselves are implemented as functions in the language! Finally, we have to be careful not to confuse these with <strong>bitwise operators</strong>, which are operators perform operations on the binary value stored in a variable. We won&rsquo;t cover those operators in this class, but the terminology is a bit confusing.</p>
<p>An expression containing a binary operator typically follows this format:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;expression&gt; &lt;operator&gt; &lt;expression&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As before, the <code>&lt;expression&gt;</code> parts can be any valid expression in the language that can be reduced to a single value, and the <code>&lt;operator&gt;</code> part is typically a single symbol, but it can also be a short keyword as well.</p>
<p>Thankfully, these operators should all be very familiar to us from mathematics already, so this is just a quick discussion of how they can be used in programming.</p>
<h2 id="addition-and-subtraction">Addition and Subtraction</h2>
<p>For starters, we can use the plus <code>+</code> and minus <code>-</code> symbols as operators to perform addition and subtraction in Python, just like in math. For example, we can add two variables together to create a third variable as shown in this example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>a <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>b <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">7</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>c <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> a <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> b
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(c)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When we run this code in the Python interpreter, we should get this result:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>12
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Likewise, we can subtract two variables using the minus symbol <code>-</code> as shown here:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="multiplication-and-division">Multiplication and Division</h2>
<p>In Python, we use the asterisk <code>*</code>, sometimes referred to as the star symbol, to multiply two values together. For example, we can find the product of two values as shown in this Python block:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>a <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>b <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">7</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>c <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> a <span style="color:#f92672">*</span> b
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(c)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When we run this code, we should see the following result displayed to the user:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>42
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Division is performed using the slash <code>/</code> symbol. A great way to think of division in programming is just like a fraction, since it uses the same symbol between the two numbers. For example, if we execute this code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">27</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>z <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">/</span> y
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(z)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>we would see this output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>9.0
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>What if the division would result in a remainder? In that case, we&rsquo;ll simply use decimal values in Python so that the result is exactly correct. For example, if we try to divide 
<span class="math align-center">$ 19 $</span> by 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span>, as in this example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>a <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">19</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>b <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>c <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> a <span style="color:#f92672">/</span> b
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(c)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When we run this code, the Python interpreter will produce the following output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>3.8
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So, as we can see, all of these operators in Python work exactly like their counterparts in math. So, we can easily use them in a way that should be very familiar to us.</p>

<h1>New Operators</h1>

</ul>
<h2 id="modulo-operator">Modulo Operator</h2>
<p>The Python programming language also includes a few math operators that are not commonly used outside of programming.</p>
<p>The first one is the <strong>modulo operator</strong>. The <strong>modulo operator</strong> is used to find the <strong>remainder</strong> of a division operation. If we think back to math again, we&rsquo;ve probably learned how to perform 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_division" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long division</a> when dividing two values. At the end, we might be left with a remainder, or a portion of the first number that is left over after the operation is complete. In many computer programs, that value is very useful, so we have a special operator we can use to find that value. In Python, we use the percent symbol <code>%</code> as the modulo operator.</p>
<p>For example, if we want to find the remainder after dividing 
<span class="math align-center">
<span class="math align-center">$  19  $</span></span> by 
<span class="math align-center">
<span class="math align-center">$  5  $</span></span>, we would use the following code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">19</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>z <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">%</span> y
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(z)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When we run this code, we would get the following output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>4
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is because the value 
<span class="math align-center">
<span class="math align-center">$  5  $</span></span> will fit into the value 
<span class="math align-center">
<span class="math align-center">$  19  $</span></span> only 
<span class="math align-center">
<span class="math align-center">$  3  $</span></span> times, and then we&rsquo;ll have the value 
<span class="math align-center">
<span class="math align-center">$  4  $</span></span> left over. Mathematically, we are saying that 
<span class="math align-center">
<span class="math align-center">$  19 / 5 = (3 * 5) + 4  $</span></span>. Since 
<span class="math align-center">
<span class="math align-center">$  4  $</span></span> is the leftover portion, it is the resulting value when we use the modulo operator.</p>
<p>In this course, we&rsquo;ll only worry about how the modulo operator works when applied to positive whole numbers. In practice, it can be applied to any numerical value, including decimal values and negative numbers, but those values are not really useful in most cases. So, to keep things simple, we&rsquo;ll only use positive whole numbers with this operator.</p>
<h2 id="exponentiation-operator">Exponentiation Operator</h2>
<p>The next operator introduced by Python is the <strong>exponentiation operator</strong>. The double star <code>**</code> operator is used to represent exponentiation, sometimes referred to the power operator. In Python, the expression <code>2 ** 3</code> would be written mathematically as 
<span class="math align-center">$ 2^3 $</span>, which is the operation of taking 
<span class="math align-center">$ 2 $</span> to the power of 
<span class="math align-center">$ 3 $</span>, or multiplying 
<span class="math align-center">$ 2 $</span> by itself 
<span class="math align-center">$ 3 $</span> times.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick example of using the <code>**</code> operator in code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span> <span style="color:#f92672">**</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(x)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(type(x))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When this code is run, we see the following output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>125
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>||| growthhack</p>
<h1 id="dont-use-the-carat-">Don&rsquo;t Use the Carat <code>^</code>!</h1>
<p>Many other programming languages and tools use the carat <code>^</code> character to represent the exponentiation operation. However, in Python, the carat <code>^</code> character is used to represent the bitwise XOR operation. So, we must be careful not to accidentally use the <code>^</code> operator when we actually mean to use the <code>**</code> operator for exponentiation.</p>
<p>|||</p>
<h2 id="integer-division-operator">Integer Division Operator</h2>
<p>Finally, Python also includes the integer division operator, represented by two forward slashes <code>//</code>, which is used to perform division that <strong>truncates</strong> the result to an integer. However, as we&rsquo;ll see on the next page, if either of the values in the operation is a <code>float</code> value, it will return a value that is a <code>float</code> data type, even though the result is an integer value.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at an example with that operator in code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>a <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">17.5</span> <span style="color:#f92672">//</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">4.5</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(a)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(type(a))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As we expect, when we run this program, we&rsquo;ll get the following output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>3.0
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;class &#39;float&#39;&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So, we see that this operator will return a <code>float</code> value, even though it is truncating the result to an integer, simply because the input values contained a <code>float</code>.</p>

<h1>Resulting Types</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=">YouTube Video</a></p>
<h4 id="resources">Resources</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/02-numbers/06-resulting-types/slides/" target="_blank">Slides</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Since Python has multiple numeric data types, there are some rules that govern which data type is produced as a result of various math operations. Thankfully, the rules themselves are pretty straightforward once they are explained.</p>
<h2 id="resulting-data-types---same-type">Resulting Data Types - Same Type</h2>
<p>The basic rule to remember, <strong>if a mathematical operator is applied to two variables of the same data type, the result will also be that data type.</strong></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see what that means in practice. Here&rsquo;s a quick example in Python using the multiplication operator on two integer values:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">10</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>z <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">*</span> y
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(z)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(type(z))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When we run this code, we should see the following output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>50
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Since both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are the <code>int</code> data type, the result of <code>x * y</code> will also be an <code>int</code> value, so the variable <code>z</code> will have that data type, as shown in this example.</p>
<p>However, there is <strong>one exception</strong> to this rule, which is the division operator <code>/</code>. In Python, the division operator will always return a <code>float</code> value, even if it is a whole number. Here&rsquo;s an example that demonstrates that:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>a <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">9</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>b <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>c <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> a <span style="color:#f92672">/</span> b
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(x)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(type(x))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print()
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> a <span style="color:#f92672">/</span> c
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(y)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(type(y))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When we run this program, we&rsquo;ll see the following output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>3.0
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;class &#39;float&#39;&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>2.25
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;class &#39;float&#39;&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So, as we can see, even though we are dividing two <code>int</code> values, we&rsquo;ll get a <code>float</code> value as a result each time we use the division operator.</p>
<p>Following the rule above, if we perform a mathematical operation between two <code>float</code> values, the resulting value will always be a <code>float</code> as well:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>a <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">2.5</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>b <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">4.5</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>c <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> a <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> b
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(c)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(type(c))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Running this code will produce this output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>7.0
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;class &#39;float&#39;&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So, even though the result is a whole number, the value that is stored is the <code>float</code> data type.</p>
<h2 id="resulting-data-types---different-type">Resulting Data Types - Different Type</h2>
<p>The other rule to remember is <strong>anytime an operation involves a <code>float</code> value and an <code>int</code> value, the result will be a <code>float</code></strong>. So, if there are mixed types, Python will default to the <code>float</code> data type.</p>
<p>This can be seen in the following example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>a <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>b <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">2.0</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>c <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> a <span style="color:#f92672">-</span> b
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(c)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(type(c))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When this code is executed, the output should look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>3.0
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;class &#39;float&#39;&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Once again, even though the result is a whole number, because the variable <code>b</code> is a <code>float</code> value, the entire result will also be a <code>float</code> value.</p>
<p>Learning the data types that are returned by a mathematical operator can be tricky, but most programmers slowly develop an intuition of how each operator works and what to expect. So, don&rsquo;t worry too much if this is confusing right now, since it will become much clearer with practice! Also, don&rsquo;t forget that we can always create a simple test program like the examples shown above to confirm the result for any operation.</p>

<h1>Order of Operations</h1>

</ul>
<p>Finally, just like in mathematics, we must also be aware of the order that these operators are applied, especially if they are combined into a single expression. Thankfully, the same rules we learned in mathematics apply in programming as well. Specifically, operators in Python are applied in this order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Operations in parentheses are resolved first, moving from left to right.</li>
<li><code>**</code> is resolved second, moving from left to right</li>
<li><code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>//</code> and <code>%</code> are resolved third, moving from left to right.</li>
<li><code>+</code> and <code>-</code> are resolved fourth, moving from left to right.</li>
</ol>
<p>You might recall the &ldquo;PEMDAS&rdquo; acronym for remembering the order of operations in math, and thankfully it still applies here. Of course, this means that there are now 4 operators that all fit in the &ldquo;multiplication and division&rdquo; portion, so we have to carefully make sure they are all taken care of in the correct way.</p>
<p>Also, as you&rsquo;ve probably already learned in math, it is always best to add extra parentheses to any expression to make the intent very clear instead of relying on the order of operations. So, when in doubt, use extra parentheses wherever needed!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s work through a quick example just to see the order of operations in practice. Here&rsquo;s a complex expression in Python that we can try to evaluate:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">8</span> <span style="color:#f92672">/</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span> <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span> <span style="color:#f92672">*</span> (<span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span> <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>) <span style="color:#f92672">-</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">7</span> <span style="color:#f92672">%</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Looking at our order of operations, the first step is to handle any expressions inside of parentheses. So, we&rsquo;ll first start with the expression <code>(3 + 1)</code> and evaluate it to <code>4</code>.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then, we&rsquo;ll go right to left and perform any multiplication, division, and modulo operations. This means we&rsquo;ll evaluate <code>8 / 4</code>, <code>5 * 4</code> and <code>7 % 4</code> and replace them with the resulting values:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">2.0</span> <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">20</span> <span style="color:#f92672">-</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Notice that <code>8 / 4</code> was reduced to <code>2.0</code> instead of just <code>2</code>. This is because the division operator is the one exception to the rule where an operator applied to two integers will result in an integer. The division operator always produces a floating-point value.</p>
<p>Finally, we&rsquo;ll perform addition and subtraction from left to right. So, we&rsquo;ll evaluate <code>2.0 + 20</code> first, and then subtract <code>3</code> from the result of that operation. At the end, we&rsquo;ll have this statement:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x = 19.0
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So, we were able to use our knowledge of the order of operations to evaluate that complex expression to a single value, 
<span class="math align-center">$ 19.0 $</span>, which will be stored in the variable <code>x</code>.</p>

<p>You are teaching a class and would like to put your students into a number of groups. You know how many students are in the class and the number of groups to create, but you aren&rsquo;t sure how many students should be in each group.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll assume that these values are stored in the <code>students</code> and <code>groups</code> variables, respectively.</p>
<p>Write a Python program to compute the ideal group size for each group in the class. When divided, the groups in the class should have no fewer than <code>size</code> people, and no more than <code>size+1</code> people, and there should be exactly <code>groups</code> groups total. For example, if there are 
<span class="math align-center">$ 15 $</span> people and the desired number of groups is 
<span class="math align-center">$ 4 $</span>, then code should start with the following two variable assignments.</p>

<p>The Python programs we&rsquo;ve written up to this point are very static - each time we run the program, it will perform the same exact operations. Since we&rsquo;re running these programs on a real computer, it might be helpful to build programs that can read and respond to input from the user, making them much more useful overall. Python includes many different ways to handle user input, but in this lab we&rsquo;ll just focus on the simple <code>input()</code> function.</p>
<h2 id="input-in-python">Input in Python</h2>
<p>The <code>input()</code> function is used to display a prompt the user and then record input. Let&rsquo;s look at a quick example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>name <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> input(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Enter your name: &#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hello &#34;</span>, end<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(name)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here, we see that the <code>input()</code> function actually accepts a message as an argument, which will be displayed to the user. After the message is printed, the user will be given a cursor to enter text immediately after it. Once the user presses the ENTER key, the <code>input()</code> function will read the input that was entered and store it as a string value or <code>str</code> data type in the <code>name</code> variable.</p>
<p>For example, if the user inputs <code>Willie Wildcat</code> at the prompt, this program&rsquo;s output will look like this:</p>

</ul>
<p>Of course, we can also read numerical input in Python using the <code>input()</code> function. To do this, we must simply use either the <code>int()</code> or <code>float()</code> function to convert the input received as a string to the correct data type.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick example program that requires two inputs for the price and quantity of an item being purchased:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>text_one <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> input(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Enter the price of one item: &#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>price <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> float(text_one)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>text_two <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> input(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Enter the quantity of items: &#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>quantity <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> int(text_two)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>cost <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> price <span style="color:#f92672">*</span> quantity
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;The total cost is $&#34;</span>, end<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(cost)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If the user wishes to purchase 
<span class="math align-center">$ 3 $</span> items at the price of 
<span class="math align-center">$ 2.75 $</span> per item, then the program&rsquo;s output would look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>Enter the price of one item: 2.75
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Enter the quantity of items: 3
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>The total cost is <span style="color:#e6db74">$</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">8</span>.<span style="color:#ae81ff">25</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In the program, we simply read each input from the user as a string value, then use the appropriate conversion function to convert it to the correct data type. For numbers including a decimal point, we use <code>float()</code>, but for whole numbers we use the <code>int()</code> function.</p>
<p>This works well if the user enters values that make sense. But, what if the user wishes to purchase a fraction of an item? Will this program work? Unfortunately, if the user enters a value with a decimal point for the second input, it can no longer be converted to an integer and we&rsquo;ll get an error:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>Enter the price of one item: 2.75
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Enter the quantity of items: 3.5
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Traceback (most recent call last):
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  File &#34;tutor.py&#34;, line 4, in &lt;module&gt;

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: &#39;3.5&#39;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>For right now, there&rsquo;s not much we can do about that error other than write programs that clearly tell the user what type of data is expected, but later we&rsquo;ll learn how to handle errors like this and prompt the user for input again.</p>

<h1>String Operators</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=">YouTube Video</a></p>

<ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="concatenate">Concatenate</h2>
<p>Python includes an operator that can be used to concatenate two strings together. We can use the plus symbol <code>+</code> between two strings to concatenate them together into a single string, making it much simpler to build more complex strings and outputs.</p>
<p>A simple example is shown below:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>first <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hello&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>second <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;World&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(first <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> second)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When executed, this code will display this output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>Hello World
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As we can see, using the <code>+</code> operator in Python to concatenate two strings together is a quick and easy way to simplify our print statements.</p>
<h2 id="concatenating-numbers">Concatenating Numbers</h2>
<p>Python also requires both sides of the <code>+</code> operator to be strings in order for concatenation to work. So, if we want to concatenate a string with a numeric value, we&rsquo;ll have to convert it to a string using the special <code>str()</code> function. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>text <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Your total is $&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>value <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">2.75</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(text <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> str(value))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When we run this program, we&rsquo;ll receive the following output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>Your total is <span style="color:#e6db74">$</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>.<span style="color:#ae81ff">75</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>However, if we forget to convert the <code>value</code> variable to a string, as in this example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>text <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Your total is $&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>value <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">2.75</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(text <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> value)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>we&rsquo;ll receive an error instead:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>Traceback (most recent call last):
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  File &#34;tutor.py&#34;, line 3, in &lt;module&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    print(text + value)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>TypeError: must be str, not float
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So, we&rsquo;ll have to be careful and make sure that we convert all of our numbers to strings before trying to concatenate them together. Of course, if both sides of the <code>+</code> operator are numbers, then it will perform addition instead of concatenation!</p>
<h2 id="repeat">Repeat</h2>
<p>Python also includes an operator that allows us to quickly repeat strings. We can use the asterisk <code>*</code> operator to effectively &ldquo;multiply&rdquo; a string. Consider this example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>word <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;repeat&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(word <span style="color:#f92672">*</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(word <span style="color:#f92672">*</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When we run this program, we&rsquo;ll see the following output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>repeatrepeat
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>repeatrepeatrepeatrepeat
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This allows us to build outputs that consist of repeated strings. We can also use this to quickly format our output into various shapes and structures!</p>
<h2 id="escape">Escape</h2>
<p>Finally, we can also use the escape operator <code>\</code> to handle some certain special characters in Python strings. We&rsquo;ve already seen this used in the newline character, which is simply the escape operator <code>\</code> followed by the letter <code>n</code>, as in <code>\n</code>.</p>
<p>However, we can also use it to include quotation marks in our string itself. Consider the following example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sentence <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hello from &#34;</span>the little apple<span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">!</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(sentence)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When we try to run this code, we&rsquo;ll get the following error:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>  File test.py, line 1
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    sentence = &#34;Hello from &#34;the little apple!&#34;&#34;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>                            ^
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>SyntaxError: invalid syntax
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is because the double quotation mark <code>&quot;</code> is used to show which part of the code is a string value, but the Python interpreter gets confused when we try to include quotation marks inside of our strings. So, we can use the escape operator <code>\</code> to tell it to treat those quotation marks as part of the string value itself, and not part of the Python code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sentence <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hello from </span><span style="color:#ae81ff">\&#34;</span><span style="color:#e6db74">the little apple!</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">\&#34;</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(sentence)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This program will execute properly and produce the following output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>Hello from &#34;the little apple!&#34;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Notice that the quotation marks now appear correctly in the output, but the escape operators are not shown. There are many other special ways to use the escape operator in Python, all of which can be found in the 

<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python Documentation</a>.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle tip">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Single and Double Quotes</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>Python also allows us to mix single and double quotes in a string, as long as we use them consistently, So, we can change the previous example to use single quotes around the string itself, and remove the escape operator from the double quotes, which will result in this code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sentence <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;Hello from &#34;the little apple!&#34;&#39;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(sentence)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This code will also produce the desired output. However, in this class we won&rsquo;t use single quotes around strings, just for consistency. Many other programming languages don&rsquo;t allow this, so we encourage you to learn how to use the escape operator to handle these situations.</p>

<h1>F-Strings</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=">YouTube Video</a></p>

<li><a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/03-strings-input/04-f-strings/slides/" target="_blank">Slides</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Python also includes another method of building strings, which are known as &ldquo;F-strings&rdquo;. F-strings allow us to put placeholders in strings that are later replaced with values from variables, effectively creating a way to build &ldquo;templates&rdquo; that can be used throughout our program.</p>
<p>The easiest way to see how this works is looking at a few examples. Let&rsquo;s start with a simple one:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>name <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> input(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Enter your name: &#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#e6db74">f</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hello </span><span style="color:#e6db74">{</span>name<span style="color:#e6db74">}</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If the user inputs <code>&quot;Willie Wildcat&quot;</code> when prompted, then this code will produce this output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>Enter your name: Willie Wildcat
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Hello Willie Wildcat
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>There are many important parts to this example, so let&rsquo;s look at each one individually. First, in the <code>print()</code> statement, we see the string <code>&quot;Hello {name}&quot;</code>. This is an example of a <strong>template string</strong>, which includes a set of curly braces <code>{}</code> as <strong>placeholders</strong> for data to be inserted. Each template string can have unlimited sets of curly braces. Inside of each set of curly braces, we can place the variable or expression that will be printed at that location.</p>
<p>Also, we notice that in front of the string, we see the character <code>f</code>. Preceding a string with <code>f</code> outside of the quotation marks will denote the string as an f-string (hence the name), which allows the values inside to be <strong>interpolated</strong>. Interpolation is the term used when formatting marks in a string, such as the curly braces in an f-string, are interpreted and replaced with the correct values they represent.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle tip">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Advanced Formatting</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>Python f-strings can do many powerful things, such as handle more complex formatting and multiple lines. For right now, we&rsquo;ll just use simple variable placeholders in our f-strings, but over time we&rsquo;ll introduce additional ways to use f-strings to achieve the desired output.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>The most powerful use of f-strings is to insert numerical values directly into strings without having to convert each value directly to the <code>str</code> data type - the interpolation process handles this for us.</p>
<p>For example, we can update our previous program to use f-strings to display the output in a single <code>print()</code> statement, and we can also add additional information with ease:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>text_one <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> input(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Enter the price of one item: &#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>price <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> float(text_one)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>text_two <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> input(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Enter the quantity of items: &#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>quantity <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> int(text_two)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>cost <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> price <span style="color:#f92672">*</span> quantity
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#e6db74">f</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span><span style="color:#e6db74">{</span>quantity<span style="color:#e6db74">}</span><span style="color:#e6db74"> items at $</span><span style="color:#e6db74">{</span>price<span style="color:#e6db74">}</span><span style="color:#e6db74"> each is $</span><span style="color:#e6db74">{</span>cost<span style="color:#e6db74">}</span><span style="color:#e6db74"> total&#34;</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When we execute this program, we&rsquo;ll see output that looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>Enter the price of one item: 2.75
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Enter the quantity of items: 3
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>3 items at <span style="color:#e6db74">$</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>.<span style="color:#ae81ff">75</span> each is <span style="color:#e6db74">$</span>8.25 total
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This example shows how easy it is to build complex output strings using f-strings.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Format Method</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>Prior to the introduction of f-strings, it was common to use the <code>format()</code> method to place values inside of a template string. The last line of the previous example would look like this using the format method:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span><span style="color:#e6db74">{}</span><span style="color:#e6db74"> items at $</span><span style="color:#e6db74">{}</span><span style="color:#e6db74"> each is $</span><span style="color:#e6db74">{}</span><span style="color:#e6db74"> total&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span>format(quantity, price, cost))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As we can see, the <code>format()</code> method receives each value as an argument, and it will replace the curly brace placeholders <code>{}</code> in the template string with each value, working from left to right. The output produced will be identical to the f-string in the example above.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t use the <code>format()</code> method in this class, but you may see it in many online tutorials and documentation since f-strings were introduced relatively recently.</p>

</ul>
<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s look at how we can rewrite some of our previous Python programs by combining expressions into more complex statements. Just like we saw in pseudocode, Python also allows us to perform multiple actions on a single line of code, provided they can all be combined in some way to create a single statement.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider the example on the previous page, shown here:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>text_one <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> input(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Enter the first number: &#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>one <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> int(text_one)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>text_two <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> input(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Enter the second number: &#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>two <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> int(text_two)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>one <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> one <span style="color:#f92672">*</span> one
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>two <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> two <span style="color:#f92672">*</span> two
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>total <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> one <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> two
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#e6db74">f</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;The sum of squares of </span><span style="color:#e6db74">{</span>one<span style="color:#e6db74">}</span><span style="color:#e6db74"> and </span><span style="color:#e6db74">{</span>two<span style="color:#e6db74">}</span><span style="color:#e6db74"> is </span><span style="color:#e6db74">{</span>total<span style="color:#e6db74">}</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>There are many ways we can write this program to perform the same work. For example, the process of computing the sum of squares itself can actually be reduced to a single line of code as seen below:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>total <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> (one <span style="color:#f92672">*</span> one) <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> (two <span style="color:#f92672">*</span> two)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We can perform multiple mathematical operations in a single expression, and as long as we either use parentheses or pay attention to the order of operations, we&rsquo;ll get the expected answer. We don&rsquo;t have to store the intermediate values in variables, since Python will do that for us when it evaluates the expression.</p>
<p>Likewise, we can put the <code>input()</code> function inside of the <code>int()</code> function, allowing us to read input as a string and convert it to an integer in a single line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>one <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> int(input(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Enter the first number: &#34;</span>))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>two <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> int(input(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Enter the second number: &#34;</span>))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>total <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> (one <span style="color:#f92672">*</span> one) <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> (two <span style="color:#f92672">*</span> two)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#e6db74">f</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;The sum of squares of </span><span style="color:#e6db74">{</span>one<span style="color:#e6db74">}</span><span style="color:#e6db74"> and </span><span style="color:#e6db74">{</span>two<span style="color:#e6db74">}</span><span style="color:#e6db74"> is </span><span style="color:#e6db74">{</span>total<span style="color:#e6db74">}</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Finally, we can also move the computation of the sum of squares directly into the f-string. When Python tries to print the f-string, the interpolation process must compute that value before it can print the output.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>one <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> int(input(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Enter the first number: &#34;</span>))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>two <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> int(input(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Enter the second number: &#34;</span>))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#e6db74">f</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;The sum of squares of </span><span style="color:#e6db74">{</span>one<span style="color:#e6db74">}</span><span style="color:#e6db74"> and </span><span style="color:#e6db74">{</span>two<span style="color:#e6db74">}</span><span style="color:#e6db74"> is </span><span style="color:#e6db74">{</span>(one <span style="color:#f92672">*</span> one) <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> (two <span style="color:#f92672">*</span> two)<span style="color:#e6db74">}</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Functionally, this code will create the exact same output as the previous code, but it will do so using fewer variables and statements. Each statement is simply more complex, consisting of multiple expressions.</p>
<h2 id="concise-and-readable">Concise and Readable</h2>
<p>The real question is: which of these two examples is best? That is, which one is the preferred coding style to learn? The answer is that it really depends - both have their merits, and functionally they will work nearly identically on most modern computers and programming languages.</p>
<p>It really is a question of style - is it better to have more lines of code and variables, clearly spelling out what each step of the process is, or is it better to have shorter programs with more complex lines of code but maybe fewer variables? For beginning programmers, it is usually recommended to follow the first style, using as many variables as needed and focusing on short, concise lines of code over large, complex statements.</p>
<p>However, as we become more accustomed to programming, we&rsquo;ll find that many times it is easier to read and understand complex statements, and our code can be written in a way that better reflects what it is actually doing.</p>
<p>This is very similar to learning how to read, write, and speak in a new language. We must start with short, concise sentences, and slowly build up our knowledge of more complex statements and grammar rules until we become a fluent speaker.</p>
<p>Overall, the best advice to follow is to make your code readable to both yourself and anyone else who may have to read and maintain the code. As long as it is clear what the code is doing based on what it says, it is probably a good style to follow. As we continue to learn more, we&rsquo;ll slowly refine our coding style to be one that is easy to follow and understand for everyone.</p>

<p>In this lab, we&rsquo;re going to introduce another data type in Python, the <strong>Boolean</strong> data type. Working with Boolean values in programming is a very important skill to learn.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in this course, we&rsquo;ve already learned about Boolean values and how they work, so we won&rsquo;t cover that information again here. Feel free to refer to other areas in this course for more background on Booleans, Boolean Logic, Boolean Algebra, and other related topics.</p>
<p>In this lab, we&rsquo;ll learn how to create Boolean values in Python, as well as the various Boolean operators and comparators that can we can use in our code. Then, we&rsquo;ll explore how to use conditional statements to affect the <strong>control flow</strong> of our programs. This allows us to build programs that will perform different tasks based on the input we receive from the user, which is a very key concept in programming. Let&rsquo;s get to it!</p>

<p>In Python, Boolean values are stored in the <code>bool</code> data type. Variables of the <code>bool</code> data type can only store one of two values, <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>. So, a Boolean value is really the simplest data value we can imagine - it is a single binary bit representing a value of <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>.</p>
<p>To create a Boolean variable in Python, we can simply assign those values to a variable in an assignment statement:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>a <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">True</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>b <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">False</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(a)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(type(b))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When we execute that code, we&rsquo;ll see the following output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>True
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;class &#39;bool&#39;&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In Python, we use the <strong>keywords</strong> <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> to represent Boolean values. In Python, it is very important to make sure these values are capitalized, otherwise the program will not work properly. Also, since these are keywords and not strings, we don&rsquo;t need to put them in quotation marks.</p>
<h2 id="converting-between-data-types">Converting Between Data Types</h2>
<p>Python includes the special <code>bool()</code> function, which can be used to convert any data type into a Boolean value. The <code>bool()</code> function follows these rules to determine what to return:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the input is the value <code>False</code>, the value <code>0</code>, the value <code>None</code>, or anything with 0 length, including the empty string, it will return <code>False</code>.</li>
<li>Otherwise, for all other values it will return <code>True</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at a couple of quick examples. First, let&rsquo;s try to convert the strings <code>&quot;True&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;False&quot;</code> to their Boolean equivalents:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(bool(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;True&#34;</span>))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(bool(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;False&#34;</span>))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When this code is executed, we&rsquo;ll see this output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>True
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>True
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This seems a bit strange, since the string <code>&quot;False&quot;</code> ended up creating the Boolean value <code>True</code>. However, if we look at the rules above, since the string <code>&quot;False&quot;</code> has a length greater than 1, and it is not any of the special values listed above, it should always result in the Boolean value <code>True</code>.</p>
<p>In this example, we can check a couple of special values using the <code>bool()</code> function:</p>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(bool(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;&#34;</span>))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this case, we&rsquo;ll see the following output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>False
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>True
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>False
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here, we see that the value <code>0</code>, as well as the empty string <code>&quot;&quot;</code>, both result in a value of <code>False</code>. However, the value 1 is <code>True</code>, since it is a non-zero value.</p>
<p>In practice, we won&rsquo;t use the <code>bool()</code> function directly very often. Instead, if we want to determine if a user inputs a <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> value, we can just use one of the Boolean comparators that we&rsquo;ll see later in this lab.</p>

<p>Python also includes several operators that can be applied to one or two Boolean values. These operators make up the basis of Boolean logic, and allow us to construct complex expressions of Boolean values. Let&rsquo;s quickly review the three basic Boolean operators present in Python.</p>
<h2 id="and-operator">And Operator</h2>
<p>In Python, we use the keyword <code>and</code> to perform the Boolean <code>and</code> operation. This operator will return <code>True</code> if both input values are also <code>True</code>, otherwise it will return <code>False</code>.</p>
<p>This corresponds to the following truth table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center">Variable 1</th>
<th style="text-align:center">Variable 2</th>
<th style="text-align:center">Result</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">F</td>
<td style="text-align:center">F</td>
<td style="text-align:center">F</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">F</td>
<td style="text-align:center">T</td>
<td style="text-align:center">F</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">T</td>
<td style="text-align:center">F</td>
<td style="text-align:center">F</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">T</td>
<td style="text-align:center">T</td>
<td style="text-align:center">T</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick example of the <code>and</code> operator in Python:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">True</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">False</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(x <span style="color:#f92672">and</span> y)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When we run this Python code, we should see this output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>False
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Since the variable <code>y</code> is <code>False</code>, the resulting value is also <code>False</code>.</p>
<h2 id="or-operator">Or Operator</h2>
<p>Likewise, the keyword <code>or</code> is used in Python for the Boolean <code>or</code> operation. This operator will return <code>True</code> if either of the input values is <code>True</code>, but it will return <code>False</code> if neither of them are <code>True</code>.</p>
<p>This corresponds to the following truth table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center">Variable 1</th>
<th style="text-align:center">Variable 2</th>
<th style="text-align:center">Result</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">F</td>
<td style="text-align:center">F</td>
<td style="text-align:center">F</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">F</td>
<td style="text-align:center">T</td>
<td style="text-align:center">T</td>

<td style="text-align:center">T</td>
<td style="text-align:center">F</td>

<td style="text-align:center">T</td>
<td style="text-align:center">T</td>
<td style="text-align:center">T</td>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at an example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>a <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">False</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>b <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">True</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(a <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> b)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When we execute this code, we&rsquo;ll get this output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>True
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Since <code>b</code> is <code>True</code>, we know that at least one input is <code>True</code> and the result of <code>a or b</code> is also <code>True</code>.</p>
<h2 id="not-operator">Not Operator</h2>
<p>Finally, Python uses the keyword <code>not</code> to represent the Boolean <code>not</code> operation, which simply inverts a Boolean value from <code>True</code> to <code>False</code> and vice-versa.</p>
<p>This corresponds to the following truth table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center">Variable 1</th>
<th style="text-align:center">Result</th>

<td style="text-align:center">T</td>
<td style="text-align:center">F</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">True</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#f92672">not</span> <span style="color:#f92672">not</span> x)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When we run this code, we&rsquo;ll see this printed to the terminal:</p>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>True
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Since <code>x</code> is <code>True</code>, we know that <code>not x</code> is <code>False</code>. We can then perform the <code>not</code> operation again, on that result, as shown in <code>not not x</code>, which will result in the original value of <code>x</code>, which is <code>True</code>.</p>

<h1>Boolean Comparators</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE5Lb58y1wI">YouTube Video</a></p>
<!-- No Video Changes? -->
<h4 id="resources">Resources</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/04-conditionals/04-comparators/slides/" target="_blank">Slides</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Python also uses various <strong>comparators</strong> to allow us to compare values of many different data types to produce a Boolean value. We can compare numbers, strings, and many other data types in Python using these comparators.</p>
<p>The basic comparators in Python are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>==</code> equal</li>
<li><code>!=</code> not equal</li>
<li><code>&lt;</code> less than</li>
<li><code>&lt;=</code> less than or equal to</li>
<li><code>&gt;</code> greater than</li>
<li><code>&gt;=</code> greater than or equal to</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that the equal comparator in Python now uses two equals signs <code>==</code> instead of a single one. This is because the single equals sign <code>=</code> is used in the assignment statement, and we don&rsquo;t want to confuse a Boolean comparator for an assignment. So, in Python, as in most other programming languages, we use two equals signs <code>==</code> when comparing values, and one equals sign <code>=</code> when we are storing a value in a variable.</p>
<h2 id="comparing-values">Comparing values</h2>
<p>Just like in pseudocode, we usually only want to compare values of the same data type using comparators. It really only makes sense to compare strings to strings, and Booleans to Booleans. However, for the numeric data types <code>int</code> and <code>float</code>, we can easily compare values of either data type together in Python.</p>
<p>Consider the following example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5.0</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(x <span style="color:#f92672">==</span> y)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When we execute this code, we&rsquo;ll get this output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>True
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Even though <code>x</code> is the <code>int</code> data type and <code>y</code> is the <code>float</code> data type, they both store the same numerical value, and our comparators will work just like we expect. So, we can easily compare both integers and floating-point values in our code.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle note">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Coercion</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>Behind the scenes, when we compare an <code>int</code> and a <code>float</code> value in Python, Python will convert the values to a common data type, usually the <code>float</code> data type, using the appropriate conversion function. This is known as <strong>coercion</strong> in programming - the program is essentially forcing a value of one data type into another data type because of an operation. However, it won&rsquo;t change the data type of the variable involved, just the value it is evaluating.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>Strings in Python can also be compared using the various comparator operators. When two strings are compared using any type of &ldquo;less than&rdquo; or &ldquo;greater than&rdquo; comparator, they will be compared according to their 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_order" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lexicographic order</a>. In general, this means that each letter will be ordered based on its value in the 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ASCII</a> encoding standard.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at a quick example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>a <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;First&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>b <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;fir&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(a <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;</span> b)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When we run this code, we&rsquo;ll see this output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex"><span style="display:flex;"><span>True
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This may seem surprising, since we&rsquo;d expect the word <code>&quot;fir&quot;</code> to come before the word <code>&quot;First&quot;</code> in a dictionary, since it has fewer letters. However, in Python, the letters <code>&quot;f&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;F&quot;</code> are not treated identically. According to the 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ASCII</a> encoding standard, capital letters have a lower value than lower-case letters, so all words starting with a capital <code>&quot;F&quot;</code> will come before any words starting with a lower-case <code>&quot;f&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>This can be a bit confusing, so it is always important to remember that we can always write a quick sample program in Python to test how a particular operator will work for a given set of values. If nothing else, we can always count on our computer to produce the same result for the same operation, no matter if it is part of a larger program or a small test program.</p>
<h2 id="order-of-operations">Order of Operations</h2>
<p>Finally, Python&rsquo;s order of operations can be updated to include these Boolean comparators and operators. So, when we see an expression that combines mathematical operators with Boolean operators and comparators, we&rsquo;ll follow this order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Math operators (according to their order of operations)</li>
<li>Boolean comparators</li>
<li><code>not</code> operator</li>
<li><code>and</code> operator</li>
<li><code>or</code> operator</li>
</ol>
<p>As always, it is considered good practice to include parentheses in any complex expressions to make sure that the intent is clear, regardless of the order of operations.</p>

</ul>
<p>Now that we understand how to use Boolean values in our programs, it&rsquo;s time to put those values to use. One way to think of the result of a Boolean expression is that it helps us make a <strong>decision</strong> in our programs. For example, if we want to do something special in our program when the user inputs the value 
<span class="math align-center">$ 42 $</span> into the variable <code>x</code>, then we can write the Boolean expression <code>x == 42</code> to help us decide if the user input the correct value.</p>
<p>Once we have that decision made, we need some way to tell our program to run a different piece of code based on the outcome of that decision. In Python, as well as most other programming languages, we can use a special construct called an <strong>if statement</strong> to do this. If statements are one example of a <strong>conditional statement</strong> in programming.</p>
<p>These conditional statements allow us to affect the <strong>control flow</strong> of our programs. Effectively, we can use a Boolean expression to determine whether a particular piece of code should be executed or not. In an <strong>if statement</strong>, we include a Boolean expression and a block of statements. If the Boolean expression evaluates to <code>True</code>, then we execute the code in the block of statements. If it is <code>False</code>, then we skip the block and continue with the rest of the program.</p>
<p>The structure of an if statement in Python is shown below:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;</span>boolean expression<span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;</span>block of statements<span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this structure, we have a <code>&lt;boolean expression&gt;</code> that is evaluated. After the Boolean expression is a colon <code>:</code>, just like at the end of a function definition.</p>
<p>Then, the <code>&lt;block of statements&gt;</code> is included below the if statement&rsquo;s first line, and it must be indented one level. Again, this is very similar to the structure of a function definition in Python. In Python, the <code>&lt;block of statements&gt;</code> must include at least one line of code, otherwise Python won&rsquo;t be able to understand it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go through a couple of code tracing examples in Python Tutor to see how an if statement works in code.</p>
<h2 id="code-tracing-example---false">Code Tracing Example - False</h2>
<p>Consider this program in Python:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> int(input(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Enter a number: &#34;</span>))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">==</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">7</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;That&#39;s a lucky number!&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Thanks for playing!&#34;</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We can see this example by clicking on this 

<a href="https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#code=x%20%3D%20int%28input%28%22Enter%20a%20number%3A%20%22%29%29%0Aif%20x%20%3D%3D%207%3A%0A%20%20%20%20print%28%22That%27s%20a%20lucky%20number!%22%29%0Aprint%28%22Thanks%20for%20playing!%22%29&amp;cumulative=false&amp;curInstr=0&amp;heapPrimitives=nevernest&amp;mode=display&amp;origin=opt-frontend.js&amp;py=3&amp;rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&amp;textReferences=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python Tutor</a> link. At first, our window should look something like this:</p>
<p>When we step through the program, the first line of code will ask the user to input a number, so Python Tutor will show an input box at the bottom of the window:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/04/tutor5_1.png?classes=border,shadow" alt="Tutor 1"></p>
<p>For this first time through the program, let&rsquo;s assume the user inputs the string <code>&quot;42&quot;</code> as input:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/04/tutor5_2.png?classes=border,shadow" alt="Tutor 2"></p>
<p>So, when we click Submit, we&rsquo;ll see the integer value 
<span class="math align-center">$ 42 $</span> stored in the variable <code>x</code> in the <code>Global</code> frame:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/04/tutor5_3.png?classes=border,shadow" alt="Tutor 3"></p>
<p>At this point, we&rsquo;ve reached the if statement. The first step is to evaluate the Boolean expression <code>x == 7</code>. Since <code>x</code> is actually storing the value 
<span class="math align-center">$ 42 $</span>, this statement will evaluate to <code>False</code>. So, when we click the Next button on the state below:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/04/tutor5_4.png?classes=border,shadow" alt="Tutor 4"></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see that the program arrow jumps past the block of statements in the if statement. So, the next line will simply print the goodbye message:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/04/tutor5_5.png?classes=border,shadow" alt="Tutor 5"></p>
<p>The entire process is shown in the animation below:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/04/tutor5.gif?classes=border,shadow" alt="Tutor 5 GIF"></p>
<p>As we can see, when the Boolean expression evaluates to <code>False</code>, we&rsquo;ll just skip the block of statements inside of the if statement.</p>
<h2 id="code-tracing-example---true">Code Tracing Example - True</h2>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s see what happens when the Boolean expression evaluates to <code>True</code> instead. To see that, we can go back to the point where our program is asking for input, as shown below:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/04/tutor6_1.png?classes=border,shadow" alt="Tutor 1"></p>
<p>This time, we&rsquo;ll assume the user inputs the string <code>&quot;7&quot;</code> as input.</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/04/tutor6_2.png?classes=border,shadow" alt="Tutor 2"></p>
<p>So, when we click Submit, we&rsquo;ll see the integer value 
<span class="math align-center">$ 7 $</span> stored in the variable <code>x</code> in the <code>Global</code> frame:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/04/tutor6_3.png?classes=border,shadow" alt="Tutor 3"></p>
<p>This time, when we reach the if statement, we&rsquo;ll see that the Boolean expression <code>x == 7</code> will evaluate to <code>True</code>. So, when we click the Next button, we&rsquo;ll be taken to the block of statements inside of the if statement:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/04/tutor6_4.png?classes=border,shadow" alt="Tutor 10"></p>
<p>Here, we&rsquo;ll print the special message for finding a lucky number:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/04/tutor6_5.png?classes=border,shadow" alt="Tutor 11"></p>
<p>Then, we&rsquo;ll print the program&rsquo;s goodbye message:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/04/tutor6_6.png?classes=border,shadow" alt="Tutor 12"></p>
<p>The entire process can be seen in this animation:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/04/tutor6.gif?classes=border,shadow" alt="Tutor 2 Gif"></p>
<p>So, when the Boolean expression evaluates to <code>True</code>, we&rsquo;ll run the code inside the if statement. If it is <code>False</code>, then we&rsquo;ll just skip past the if statement and continue with the rest of our program.</p>
<h2 id="if-statement-flowchart">If Statement Flowchart</h2>
<p>Another way to visualize an if statement is using a flowchart. Consider the following Python code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> int(input(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Input: &#34;</span>))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  print(x)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Goodbye&#34;</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This Python code can also be represented as the flowchart shown below:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/04/ifthen.png?classes=border,shadow" alt="If Flowchart"></p>
<p>When we read flowcharts like this, we typically go from top to bottom, starting with the circle labeled &ldquo;START&rdquo;. The first  step is to read input from the user, and store that value in the variable <code>x</code>.</p>
<p>Then, we reach a decision node, which uses a diamond shape. This node asks if the value in the variable <code>x</code> is greater than 0. Notice that there are two lines coming from the decision node: one labeled &ldquo;True&rdquo; and another labeled &ldquo;False&rdquo;. They correspond to the possible values that can result from evaluating the Boolean expression <code>x &gt; 0</code>. So, if the result of that expression is <code>True</code>, then we&rsquo;ll follow the path that exits the diamond from the side labeled &ldquo;True&rdquo;, and we&rsquo;ll output the value <code>x</code> to the terminal. Once that is done, we can follow that path around to the next box that will output the string <code>&quot;Goodbye&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>If that result is <code>False</code>, then we&rsquo;ll follow the downward path labeled &ldquo;False&rdquo; and skip the path to the side. Instead, we&rsquo;ll just reach the line that prints <code>&quot;Goodbye&quot;</code> and then end the program.</p>
<p>As we learn how to use if statements in our code, we might find it easier to use flowcharts or other tools to help understand exactly what our program will do. The path that a program takes through a flowchart like this is called the <strong>control flow</strong> of the program. We&rsquo;ll discuss that topic a bit more toward the end of this lab.</p>

</ul>
<p>Python also supports another kind of conditional statement, the <strong>if-else statement</strong>. An if-else statement contains a single Boolean expression, but two blocks of code. If the Boolean expression evaluates to <code>True</code>, then one block of statements is executed. If it is <code>False</code>, then the other block will be executed.</p>
<p>The general structure of an if-else statement in Python is shown below:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;</span>boolean expression<span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;</span>block of statements <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span><span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Notice that the <code>else</code> keyword is followed by a colon, just like the first line of the if-else statement. As we&rsquo;d expect, the first block of statements is executed if the <code>&lt;boolean expression&gt;</code> portion is <code>True</code> and the second block is executed if it is <code>False</code>.</p>
<p>Once again, let&rsquo;s go through a couple of code traces using Python Tutor to explore how an if-else statement works in Python.</p>
<h2 id="code-tracing-example---true">Code Tracing Example - True</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a simple Python program that contains an if-else statement:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> int(input(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Enter a number: &#34;</span>))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">&gt;=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Your number is positive!&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Your number is negative&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Thanks for playing!&#34;</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This program accepts an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and then determines if the integer is a positive or negative number. Let&rsquo;s go through this program a couple of times in Python Tutor to see how it works. As always, you can copy and paste this code into Python Tutor, or click this 

<a href="https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#code=x%20%3D%20int%28input%28%22Enter%20a%20number%3A%20%22%29%29%0Aif%20x%20%3E%3D%200%3A%0A%20%20%20%20print%28%22Your%20number%20is%20positive!%22%29%0Aelse%3A%0A%20%20%20%20print%28%22Your%20number%20is%20negative%22%29%0Aprint%28%22Thanks%20for%20playing!%22%29&amp;cumulative=false&amp;curInstr=0&amp;heapPrimitives=nevernest&amp;mode=display&amp;origin=opt-frontend.js&amp;py=3&amp;rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&amp;textReferences=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python Tutor</a> link to follow along!</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll start an input prompt as shown here:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/04/tutor7_1.png?classes=border,shadow" alt="Tutor 1"></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume that the user inputs the string <code>&quot;5&quot;</code> here.</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/04/tutor7_2.png?classes=border,shadow" alt="Tutor 2"></p>
<p>That means that the integer value 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span> will be stored in the variable named <code>x</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/04/tutor7_3.png?classes=border,shadow" alt="Tutor 3"></p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;ve reached the if-else statement. So, we&rsquo;ll need to evaluate the Boolean expression <code>x &gt;= 0</code>. Since <code>x</code> is currently storing the value 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span>, this expression will evaluate to <code>True</code>. Therefore, we&rsquo;ll move into the first block of statements in the if-else statement:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/04/tutor7_4.png?classes=border,shadow" alt="Tutor 4"></p>
<p>From here, we&rsquo;ll print the message that the user&rsquo;s input was a positive number, as well as the goodbye message at the end of the program. It will entirely skip the second block of statements in the if-else statement, as we can see here:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/04/tutor7_6.png?classes=border,shadow" alt="Tutor 6"></p>
<p>A full execution of this program is shown in the animation below:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/04/tutor7.gif?classes=border,shadow" alt="Tutor 7 GIF"></p>
<h2 id="code-tracing-example---false">Code Tracing Example - False</h2>
<p>What if the user inputs a negative value, such as 
<span class="math align-center">$ -7 $</span>? In that case, we&rsquo;ll be at this state in our program:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/04/tutor8_3.png?classes=border,shadow" alt="Tutor 10"></p>
<p>From here, we&rsquo;ll evaluate the Boolean expression <code>x &gt;= 0</code> again. This time, however, we&rsquo;ll see that it evaluates to <code>False</code>, so we&rsquo;ll jump down to the second block of statements inside the if-else statement:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/04/tutor8_4.png?classes=border,shadow" alt="Tutor 11"></p>
<p>This will print a message to the user that the input was a negative number, and then it will print the goodbye message. We completely skipped the first block of statements:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/04/tutor8_6.png?classes=border,shadow" alt="Tutor 12"></p>
<p>A complete run through this program is shown in this animation:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/04/tutor8.gif?classes=border,shadow" alt="Tutor Gif 2"></p>
<p>So, as we expect, an if-else statement allows us to run one block of statements or the other, based on the value of the Boolean expression. It is a very powerful piece of code, and it allows us to write programs that perform different actions based on the input provided by the user or the values of other variables.</p>
<h2 id="if-else-statement-flowchart">If-Else Statement Flowchart</h2>
<p>Another way to visualize an if-else statement is using a flowchart. Consider the following Python code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> int(input(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Input: &#34;</span> ))

<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/04/ifthenelse.png?classes=border,shadow" alt="If Flowchart"></p>
<p>Once again, we start at the top of the flowchart at the circle labeled &ldquo;START&rdquo;. From there, we read an input from the user and store it in the variable <code>x</code>. At this point, we reach our if-else statement&rsquo;s decision node, represented by the diamond. Here, we are using the Boolean expression <code>x &gt;= 0</code> to determine which branch to follow. So, if the user inputs a positive value, then we&rsquo;ll follow the path to the right that is labeled &ldquo;True&rdquo;, which will simply print the value of <code>x</code> to the screen.</p>
<p>However, if the user inputs a negative value for <code>x</code>, then the Boolean expression will be <code>False</code> and we&rsquo;ll follow the path to the left labeled &ldquo;False&rdquo;. In this branch, we&rsquo;ll print the value of <code>(-1 * x)</code> to the screen, which simply removes the negative sign from the value in <code>x</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, after each path, we&rsquo;ll merge back together to run the last piece of code, which prints the <code>&quot;Goodbye&quot;</code> message to the screen.</p>
<p>Notice that there is no way to print both <code>x</code> and <code>-1 * x</code> in the same execution of this program. If we follow the arrows through the flowchart, we see that we can only follow one branch or the other, and not both. This is an important concept to remember when working with if-else statements! The <strong>control flow</strong> of the program can only pass through one of the two blocks of statements, but not both.</p>

</ul>
<p>One important concept to understand when writing if statements and if-else statements is the <strong>control flow</strong> of the program. Before we learned about conditional statements, our programs had a linear control flow - there was exactly one pathway through the program, no matter what. Each time we ran the program, the same code would be executed each time in the same order. However, with the introduction of conditional statements, this is no longer the case.</p>
<p>Because of this, testing our programs becomes much more complicated. We cannot simply test it once or twice, but instead we should plan on testing our programs multiple times to make sure they work exactly the way we want. So, let&rsquo;s go through some of the various ways we can test our programs that include conditional statements.</p>
<h2 id="simple-example">Simple Example</h2>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s consider this example program:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> int(input(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Enter a number: &#34;</span>))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> int(input(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Enter a number: &#34;</span>))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> y <span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">10</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Branch 1&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Branch 2&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">-</span> y <span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">10</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Branch 3&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Branch 4&#34;</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We can represent the two if-else statements in this program in the following flowchart as well:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/04/control.png?classes=border,shadow" alt="Control Flow Flowchart"></p>
<h3 id="branch-coverage">Branch Coverage</h3>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s consider how we can achieve <strong>branch coverage</strong> by executing all of the branches in this program. This means that we should test the program using different sets of inputs that will run different branches in the code. Our goal is to execute the code in each branch at least once. In this example, we see that there are four branches, helpfully labeled with the numbers one through four in the <code>print()</code> statements included in each branch.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s start with a simple set of inputs, which will store 
<span class="math align-center">$ 6 $</span> in both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. Which branches will be executed in this case? Before reading ahead, see if you can work through the code above and determine which branches are executed?</p>
<p>In the first if-else statement, we&rsquo;ll see the <code>x + y</code> is equal to 
<span class="math align-center">$ 12 $</span>, which is greater than 
<span class="math align-center">$ 10 $</span>, making that Boolean statement <code>True</code>. So, we&rsquo;ll execute the code in branch 1 this time through. When we reach the second if-else statement, we&rsquo;ll compute the value of <code>x - y</code> to be 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span>, which is less than 
<span class="math align-center">$ 10 $</span>. In this case, that makes the Boolean statement <code>False</code>, so we&rsquo;ll execute branch 4. Therefore, by providing the inputs <code>6</code> and <code>6</code>, we&rsquo;ve executed the code in branches 1 and 4.</p>
<p>So, can we think of a second set of inputs that will execute the code in branches 2 and 3? That can be a bit tricky - we want to come up with a set of numbers that add to a value less than 
<span class="math align-center">$ 10 $</span>, but with a difference that is greater than 
<span class="math align-center">$ 10 $</span>. However, we can easily do this using negative numbers! So, let&rsquo;s assume that the user inputs 
<span class="math align-center">$ 6 $</span> for <code>x</code> and 
<span class="math align-center">$ -6 $</span> for <code>y</code>. When we reach the first if-else statement, we can compute the result of <code>x + y</code>, which is 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span>. That is less than 
<span class="math align-center">$ 10 $</span>, so the Boolean statement is <code>False</code> and we&rsquo;ll execute the code in branch 2. So far, so good!</p>
<p>Next, we&rsquo;ll reach the second if-else statement. Here, we&rsquo;ll compute the result of <code>x - y</code>. This time, we know that 
<span class="math align-center">$ 6 - -6 $</span> is actually 
<span class="math align-center">$ 12 $</span>, which is greater than 
<span class="math align-center">$ 10 $</span>. So, since that Boolean expression is <code>True</code>, we&rsquo;ll run the code in branch 3. That&rsquo;s exactly what we wanted!</p>
<p>Therefore, if we want to test this program and try to execute all the branches, we only have to provide two pairs of inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="math align-center">$ 6 $</span> and 
<span class="math align-center">$ 6 $</span></li>
<li>
<span class="math align-center">$ 6 $</span> and 
<span class="math align-center">$ -6 $</span></li>
</ul>
<p>However, that&rsquo;s only one way we can test our program. There are many other methods we can follow!</p>
<h3 id="path-coverage">Path Coverage</h3>
<p>A more thorough way to test our programs is to achieve <strong>path coverage</strong>. In this method, our goal is to execute all possible paths through the program. This means that we want to execute every possible ordering of branches! So, since our program has 4 branches in two different if-else statements, the possible orderings of branches are listed below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Branch 1 -&gt; Branch 3</li>
<li>Branch 1 -&gt; Branch 4</li>
<li>Branch 2 -&gt; Branch 3</li>
<li>Branch 2 -&gt; Branch 4</li>
</ol>
<p>As we can see, there are twice as many paths as there are branches in this case! We&rsquo;ve already covered ordering 2 and 3 from this list, so let&rsquo;s see if we can find inputs that will cover the other two orderings.</p>
<p>First, we want to find a set of inputs that will execute branch 1 followed by branch 3. So, we&rsquo;ll need two numbers that add to a value greater than 10, but their difference is also greater than 10. So, let&rsquo;s try the value 
<span class="math align-center">$ 12 $</span> for <code>x</code> and 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span> for <code>y</code>. In that case, their sum is greater than 
<span class="math align-center">$ 10 $</span>, so we&rsquo;ll execute branch 1 in the first if-else statement. When we reach the second if-else statement, we can evaluate <code>x - y</code> and find that it is also 
<span class="math align-center">$ 12 $</span>, which is greater than 
<span class="math align-center">$ 10 $</span> and we&rsquo;ll execute branch 3. So, we&rsquo;ve covered the first ordering!</p>
<p>The last ordering can be done in a similar way - we need a pair of inputs with a sum less than 
<span class="math align-center">$ 10 $</span> and also a difference less than 
<span class="math align-center">$ 10 $</span>. A simple answer would be to input 
<span class="math align-center">$ 4 $</span> for both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. In this case, their sum is 
<span class="math align-center">$ 8 $</span> and their difference is 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span>, so we&rsquo;ll end up executing branch 2 of the first if-else statement, and branch 4 of the second if-else statement. So, that covers the last ordering.</p>
<p>As we can see, path coverage will also include branch coverage, but it is a bit more difficult to achieve. If we want to cover all possible paths, we should test our program with these 4 sets of inputs now:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="math align-center">$ 6 $</span> and 
<span class="math align-center">$ 6 $</span></li>
<li>
<span class="math align-center">$ 6 $</span> and 
<span class="math align-center">$ -6 $</span></li>
<li>
<span class="math align-center">$ 12 $</span> and 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span></li>
<li>
<span class="math align-center">$ 4 $</span> and 
<span class="math align-center">$ 4 $</span></li>
</ul>
<p>There&rsquo;s still one more way we can test our program, so let&rsquo;s try that out as well.</p>
<h3 id="edge-cases">Edge Cases</h3>
<p>Finally, we should also use a set of inputs that test the &ldquo;edges&rdquo; of the Boolean expressions used in each if-else statement. An <strong>edge</strong> is a value that is usually the smallest or largest value before the Boolean expression&rsquo;s output would change. So, an <strong>edge case</strong> is simply a set of input values that are specifically created to be edges for the Boolean expressions in our code.</p>
<p>For example, let&rsquo;s look at the first Boolean logic statement, <code>x + y &gt; 10</code>. If we are simply considering whole numbers, then the possible edge cases for this Boolean expression are when the sum of <code>x + y</code> is exactly 
<span class="math align-center">$ 10 $</span> and 
<span class="math align-center">$ 11 $</span>. When it is 
<span class="math align-center">$ 10 $</span> or below, the result of the Boolean expression is <code>False</code>, but when the result is 
<span class="math align-center">$ 11 $</span> or higher, then the Boolean expression is <code>true</code>. So, 
<span class="math align-center">$ 10 $</span> and 
<span class="math align-center">$ 11 $</span> represent the <strong>edge</strong> between <code>True</code> values and <code>False</code> values. The same applies to the Boolean expression in the second if-else statement.</p>
<p>So, to truly test the edge cases in this example, we should come up with a set of values with the sum and difference of exactly 
<span class="math align-center">$ 10 $</span> and exactly 
<span class="math align-center">$ 11 $</span>. For the first one, a very easy solution would be to set <code>x</code> to 
<span class="math align-center">$ 10 $</span> and <code>y</code> to 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span>. In this case, both the sum and the difference is 
<span class="math align-center">$ 10 $</span>, so we&rsquo;re on the <code>False</code> side of the edge. Our program will correctly execute branches 2 and 4.</p>
<p>For the other edge, we can use a similar set of inputs where <code>x</code> is 
<span class="math align-center">$ 11 $</span> and <code>y</code> is still 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span>. In this case, both the sum and difference is 
<span class="math align-center">$ 11 $</span>, so each Boolean expression will evaluate to <code>True</code> and we&rsquo;ll execute branches 1 and 3.</p>
<p>Why is this important? To understand that, we must think a bit about what was intended by this program. What if the program should execute branches 1 and 3 if the value is greater than or equal to 
<span class="math align-center">$ 10 $</span>? In that case, both of our chosen edge cases should execute branches 1 and 3, but instead we saw that the edge case 
<span class="math align-center">$ 10 $</span> executed branches 2 and 4 instead. This is a simple <strong>logic error</strong> that happens all the time in programming - we simply forgot to use the greater than or equal to symbol <code>&gt;=</code> instead of the simple greater than symbol <code>&gt;</code> in our code. So, a minor typo like that can change the entire execution of our program, and we wouldn&rsquo;t have noticed it in <em>any</em> of our previous tests. This is why it is important to test the edge cases along with other inputs.</p>
<p>In fact, it would probably be a good idea to add a third edge case, where the sum and difference equal 
<span class="math align-center">$ 9 $</span>, just to be safe. That way, we can clearly see the difference between <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> values in this program.</p>
<p>So, the final set of values we may want to test this program with are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="math align-center">$ 6 $</span> and 
<span class="math align-center">$ 6 $</span> (branch coverage 1 and 4)</li>
<li>
<span class="math align-center">$ 6 $</span> and 
<span class="math align-center">$ -6 $</span> (branch coverage 2 and 3)</li>
<li>
<span class="math align-center">$ 12 $</span> and 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span> (path coverage 1 and 3)</li>
<li>
<span class="math align-center">$ 4 $</span> and 
<span class="math align-center">$ 4 $</span> (path coverage 2 and 4)</li>
<li>
<span class="math align-center">$ 9 $</span> and 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span> (edge case 2 and 4)</li>
<li>
<span class="math align-center">$ 10 $</span> and 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span> (edge case 2 and 4)</li>
<li>
<span class="math align-center">$ 11 $</span> and 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span> (edge case 1 and 3)</li>
</ul>
<p>As we can see, even a simple program with just a few lines of code can require substantial testing to really be sure it works correctly! This doesn&rsquo;t even include other types of testing, where we make sure it works properly with invalid input values, decimal numbers, and other situations. That type of testing is really outside of the scope of this lab, but we&rsquo;ll learn more about some of those topics later in this course.</p>
<h2 id="complex-example">Complex Example</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go through one more example to get some more practice with creating test inputs for conditional statements. For this example, let&rsquo;s consider the following program in Python:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>a <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> int(input(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Enter a number: &#34;</span>))

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This program is a bit trickier to evaluate. First, it accepts two numbers as input. Then, it will check to see if the first number is at least 5 times the second number. It will print an appropriate message in either case. Then, it will check to see if the first number is evenly divided by the second number, and once again it will print a message in either case.</p>
<h3 id="branch-coverage-1">Branch Coverage</h3>
<p>To achieve <strong>branch coverage</strong>, we need to come up with a set of inputs that will cause each print statement to be executed. Thankfully, the branches are numbered using comments in the Python code, so it is easy to keep track of them.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with an easy input - we&rsquo;ll set <code>a</code> to 
<span class="math align-center">$ 25 $</span> and <code>b</code> to 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span>. This means that <code>a // b</code> is equal to 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span>, so we&rsquo;ll go into branch 1 in the first if statement. The second if statement will go into branch 3, since <code>a % b</code> is exactly 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span> because 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span> stored in <code>b</code> will evenly divide the 
<span class="math align-center">$ 25 $</span> stored in <code>a</code> without any remainder. So, we&rsquo;ve covered branches 1 and 3 with this input.</p>
<p>For another input, we can choose 
<span class="math align-center">$ 21 $</span> for <code>a</code> and 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span> for <code>b</code>. In the first if statement, we&rsquo;ll see that <code>a // b</code> is now 
<span class="math align-center">$ 4 $</span>, so we&rsquo;ll go into branch 2 instead. Likewise, in the second if statement we&rsquo;ll execute branch 4, since <code>a % b</code> is equal to 
<span class="math align-center">$ 1 $</span> with these inputs. That means we&rsquo;ve covered branches 2 and 4 with these inputs.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can achieve branch coverage with just two inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="math align-center">$ 25 $</span> and 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span></li>
<li>
<span class="math align-center">$ 21 $</span> and 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="path-coverage-1">Path Coverage</h3>
<p>Recall that there are four paths through a program that consists of two if statements in a row:</p>
<ol>
<li>Branch 1 -&gt; Branch 3</li>
<li>Branch 1 -&gt; Branch 4</li>
<li>Branch 2 -&gt; Branch 3</li>
<li>Branch 2 -&gt; Branch 4</li>
</ol>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already covered the first and last of these paths, so we must simply find inputs for the other two.</p>
<p>One input we can try is 
<span class="math align-center">$ 31 $</span> and 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span>. In the first if statement, we&rsquo;ll go to branch 1 since <code>a // b</code> will be 
<span class="math align-center">$ 6 $</span> this time. However, when we get to the second if statement, we&rsquo;ll find that there is a remainder of 
<span class="math align-center">$ 1 $</span> after computing <code>a % b</code>, so we&rsquo;ll go to branch 4 instead. This covers the second path.</p>
<p>The third path can be covered by inputs 
<span class="math align-center">$ 20 $</span> and 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span>. In the first if statement, we&rsquo;ll go to branch 2 because <code>a // b</code> is now 
<span class="math align-center">$ 4 $</span>, but we&rsquo;ll end up in branch 3 in the second if statement since <code>a % b</code> is exactly 0.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can achieve path coverage with these four inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="math align-center">$ 25 $</span> and 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span></li>
<li>
<span class="math align-center">$ 21 $</span> and 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span></li>
<li>
<span class="math align-center">$ 31 $</span> and 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span></li>
<li>
<span class="math align-center">$ 20 $</span> and 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="edge-cases-1">Edge Cases</h3>
<p>What about edge cases? For the first if statement, we see the statement <code>a // b &gt;= 5</code>, so that clues us into the fact that we&rsquo;ll probably want to try values that result in the numbers 
<span class="math align-center">$ 4 $</span>, 
<span class="math align-center">$ 5 $</span>, and 
<span class="math align-center">$ 6 $</span> for this statement. Thankfully, if we look at the inputs we&rsquo;ve already tried, we can see that this is already covered! By being a bit deliberate with the inputs we&rsquo;ve been choosing, we can not only achieve branch and path coverage, but we can also choose values that test the edge cases for various Boolean expressions as well.</p>
<p>Likewise, the Boolean statement in the second if statement is <code>a % b == 0</code>, so we&rsquo;ll want to try situations where <code>a % b</code> is exactly 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span>, and when it is some other value. Once again, we&rsquo;ve already covered both of these instances in our sample inputs!</p>
<p>So, with a bit of thinking ahead, we can come up with a set of just 4 inputs that not only achieve full path and branch coverage, but also properly test the various edge cases that are present in the program!</p>

<h1>Linear Conditionals</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTgZVE7kMq4">YouTube Video</a></p>
<h4 id="resources">Resources</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/04-conditionals/10-linear/slides/" target="_blank">Slides</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Conditional statements are a very powerful tool for programmers to use. So far in this lab, we&rsquo;ve explored simple conditional statements, including the if statement and if-else statement in Python. However, up to this point we&rsquo;ve only looked at how we can use a single conditional statement at a time in a program, which can be very limiting. Now we&rsquo;re going to explore how we can combine conditional statements in a variety of different ways to build even more complex programs. These combined, or <strong>nested</strong> conditional statements, are commonly used across all programming languages, but learning how to build and debug them takes time and practice. We&rsquo;ll work through several examples, and then you&rsquo;ll get a chance to try it yourself.</p>
<h2 id="linear-conditional-statements">Linear Conditional Statements</h2>
<p>To explore the various ways we can use conditional statements in code, let&rsquo;s start by examining the same problem using three different techniques. We&rsquo;ll use the classic 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rock Paper Scissors</a> game. In this game, two players simultaneously make one of three hand gestures, and then determine a winner based on the following diagram:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/04/rps.svg?classes=border,shadow" alt="Rock Paper Scissors"><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>For example, if the first player displays a balled fist, representing <strong>rock</strong> and the second player displays a flat hand, representing <strong>paper</strong>, then the second player wins because &ldquo;paper covers rock&rdquo; according to the rules. If the players both display the same symbol, the game is considered a tie.</p>
<p>So, to make this work, we&rsquo;re going to write a Python program that reads two inputs representing the symbols, and then we&rsquo;ll use some conditional statements to determine which player wins. A basic skeleton of this program is shown below:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>p1 <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> input(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Enter </span><span style="color:#ae81ff">\&#34;</span><span style="color:#e6db74">rock</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">\&#34;</span><span style="color:#e6db74">, </span><span style="color:#ae81ff">\&#34;</span><span style="color:#e6db74">paper</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">\&#34;</span><span style="color:#e6db74">, or </span><span style="color:#ae81ff">\&#34;</span><span style="color:#e6db74">scissors</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">\&#34;</span><span style="color:#e6db74"> for player 1: &#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>p2 <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> input(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Enter </span><span style="color:#ae81ff">\&#34;</span><span style="color:#e6db74">rock</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">\&#34;</span><span style="color:#e6db74">, </span><span style="color:#ae81ff">\&#34;</span><span style="color:#e6db74">paper</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">\&#34;</span><span style="color:#e6db74">, or </span><span style="color:#ae81ff">\&#34;</span><span style="color:#e6db74">scissors</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">\&#34;</span><span style="color:#e6db74"> for player 2: &#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># determine the winner</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Our goal, therefore, is to replace the comment <code># determine the winner</code> with a set of conditional statements and print statements to accomplish this goal.</p>
<h2 id="linear-conditional-statements-1">Linear Conditional Statements</h2>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s try to write this program using what we already know. We&rsquo;ve already learned how to use conditional statements, and it is completely possible to write this program using just a set of linear conditional statements and nothing else. So, to do this, we need to determine each possible combination of inputs, and then write an if statement for each one. Since there are 
<span class="math align-center">$ 3 $</span> possible inputs for each player, we know there are 
<span class="math align-center">$ 3 * 3 = 9 $</span> possible combinations:</p>

<p>We also have to deal with a final option where one player or the other inputs an invalid value. So, in total, we&rsquo;ll have 
<span class="math align-center">$ 10 $</span> conditional statements in our program!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s first try to make a quick flowchart of this program. Since we need 
<span class="math align-center">$ 10 $</span> conditional statements, our flowchart will have 
<span class="math align-center">$ 10 $</span> of the diamond-shaped decision nodes. Unfortunately, that would make a very large flowchart, so we&rsquo;ll only include the first three decision nodes in the flowchart shown here:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/04/linear.svg?classes=border,shadow" alt="Linear Flowchart"></p>
<p>As we can see, this flowchart is very tall, and just consists of one decision node after another. Thankfully, we should know how to implement this in code based on what we&rsquo;ve previously learned. Below is a full implementation of this program in Python, using just linear conditional statements:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This program seems a bit complex, but if we step through it one step at a time it should be easy to follow. For example, if the user inputs <code>&quot;scissors&quot;</code> for player 1 and <code>&quot;rock&quot;</code> for player 2, we just have to find the conditional statement that matches that input and print the correct output. Since we were careful about how we wrote the Boolean expressions for these conditional statements, we know that it is only possible for one of them to evaluate to true. So, we&rsquo;d say that those Boolean expressions are <strong>mutually exclusive</strong>, since it is impossible for two of them to be true at the same time.</p>
<p>Things get a bit more difficult in the last conditional statement. Here, we want to make sure the user has not input an invalid value for either player. Unfortunately, the only way to do that using linear conditional statements is to explicitly check each possible value and make sure that the user did not input that value. This can seem pretty redundant, and it indeed is! As we&rsquo;ll see later in this lab, there are better ways we can structure this program to avoid having to explicitly list all possible inputs when checking for an invalid one.</p>
<p>Before moving on, it is always a good idea to run this code yourself, either directly in Python or using Python Tutor, to make sure you understand how it works and what it does.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-version">Alternative Version</h2>
<p>There is an alternative way we can write this program using linear if statements. Instead of having an if statement for each possible combination of inputs, we can instead have a single if statement for each possible output, and construct more complex Boolean expressions that are used in each if statement. Here&rsquo;s what that would look like in Python:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this example, we now have just four if statements, but each one now requires a Boolean expression that includes multiple parts. So, this program is simultaneously more and less complex than the previous example. It has fewer lines of code, but each line can be much trickier to understand and debug.</p>
<p>Again, feel free to run this code in either Python Tutor or directly in Python to confirm that it works and make sure you understand it before continuing.</p>
<p>In terms of style, both of these options are pretty much equivalent - there&rsquo;s no reason to choose one over the other. However, we&rsquo;ll see later in this lab, there are much better ways we can write this program using chaining and nesting with conditional statements.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle note">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> PEP 8 and Pythno Style</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>The Python programming language has its own style guide, known as &ldquo;PEP 8&rdquo; to most Python programmers. One of the major conventions proposed in that guide is limiting the length of each line of code to just 79 characters, in order to make the code more readable. However, as we&rsquo;ve seen above, it is very easy to exceed that length when dealing with complex Boolean expressions, and we&rsquo;ll see this again as we add multiple levels of indentation when we nest conditional statements.</p>
<p>In this course, we won&rsquo;t worry about line length, even though some text editors may mark those lines as being incorrect in Python. Likewise, in many examples we won&rsquo;t wrap the lines to a shorter length, except for readability purposes in the videos and slides.</p>
<p>That said, it&rsquo;s definitely a good style to try and follow, and we encourage you to think about ways you can write your code to keep it as concise and readable as possible. Having shorter lines of code, while still using descriptive variable and function names, is a good start!</p>

<h1>Chaining Conditionals</h1>

</ul>
<p>In the previous example, we saw a set of linear if statements to represent a Rock Paper Scissors game. As we discussed on that page, the Boolean expressions are meant to be <strong>mutually exclusive</strong>, meaning that only one of the Boolean expressions will be true no matter what input the user provides.</p>
<p>When we have mutually exclusive Boolean expressions like this, we can instead use if-else statements to make the mutually exclusive structure of the program clearer to the user. Let&rsquo;s see how we can do that.</p>
<h2 id="chaining-conditional-statements">Chaining Conditional Statements</h2>
<p>To chain conditional statements, we can simply place the next conditional statement on the <code>False</code> branch of the first statement. This means that, if the first Boolean expression is <code>True</code>, we&rsquo;ll execute the <code>True</code> branch, and then jump to the end of the entire statement. If it is <code>False</code>, then we&rsquo;ll go to the <code>False</code> branch and try the next conditional statement. Here&rsquo;s what this would look like in a flowchart:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/04/chain.svg?classes=border,shadow" alt="Chained Flowchart"></p>
<p>This flowchart is indeed very similar to the previous one, but with one major change. Now, if any one of the Boolean expressions evaluates to <code>True</code>, that branch will be executed and then the control flow will immediately drop all the way to the end of the program, without ever testing any of the other Boolean expressions. This means that, overall, this program will be a bit more efficient than the one with linear conditional statements, because on average it will only have to try half of them before the program ends.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s take a look at what this program would look like in Python:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As we can see, this program is basically the same code as the previous program, but with the addition of a number of <code>else</code> keywords to place each subsequent conditional statement into the <code>False</code> branch of the previous one. In addition, since Python requires us to add a level of indentation for each conditional statement, we see that this program very quickly becomes difficult to read. In fact, the last Boolean expression is so long that it doesn&rsquo;t even fit well on the screen!</p>
<p>We can make a similar change to the other example on the previous page:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Again, this results in very long lines of code, but it still makes it easy to see that the program is built in the style of mutual exclusion, and only one of the <code>True</code> branches will be executed. As before, feel free to run these programs directly in Python or using Python Tutor to confirm they work and that you understand how they work before continuing.</p>
<h2 id="the-final-case">The Final Case</h2>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve built a program structure that enforces mutual exclusion, we&rsquo;ll might notice something really interesting - the final <code>if</code> statement is no longer required! This is because we&rsquo;ve already exhausted all other possible situations, so the <em>only</em> possible case is the last one. In that case, we can remove that entire statement and just replace it with the code from the <code>True</code> branch. Here&rsquo;s what that would look like in Python:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this code, there is a comment showing where the previous if statement was placed, and now it simply prints an error. Again, this is possible because we&rsquo;ve tried every possible valid combination of inputs in the previous Boolean expressions, so all that is left is invalid input. Try it yourself! See if you can come up with any valid input that isn&rsquo;t already handled by the Boolean expressions - there shouldn&rsquo;t be any of them.</p>
<h2 id="elif-keyword">Elif Keyword</h2>
<p>To help build programs that include chaining conditional statements, Python includes a special keyword <code>elif</code> for this exact situation. The <code>elif</code> keyword is a shortened version of <code>else if</code>, and it means to replace the situation where an <code>if</code> statement is directly placed inside of an <code>else</code> branch. So, when we are chaining conditional statements, we can now do so without adding additional levels of indentation.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what the previous example looks like when we use the <code>elif</code> keyword in Python:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>There we go! That&rsquo;s much easier to read, and in fact it is much closer to the examples of linear conditionals on the previous page. This is the exact same program as before, but now it is super clear that we are dealing with a mutually exclusive set of Boolean expressions. And, we can still have a single <code>else</code> branch at the very end that will be executed if none of the Boolean expressions evaluates to <code>True</code>.</p>
<p>A structure of mutually exclusive statements like this is very commonly used in programming, and Python makes it very simple to build using the <code>elif</code> keyword.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Error Condition First</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>Using chained conditional statements like this makes it easy to detect and handle errors in the final <code>else</code> block, since all other options have already been checked. However, some programmers prefer to explicitly check for errors in the input at the start of the code, <em>before</em> any other work is done. This is especially common when working with loops to prompt the user for new input in case of an error, which we&rsquo;ll learn about in a later lab.</p>
<p>When you are reading code, it is important to check both the start and end of a block of code when looking for possible error checks, since they could be included in either place. Recognizing common coding styles and conventions such as where to check for errors will help us better understand code written by others, and also make our code more readable by others.</p>

<h1>Nesting Conditionals</h1>

</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already seen how we can chain conditional statements by placing a new conditional statement inside of the <code>False</code> branch of another conditional statement. If we think about that, however, that implies that we probably should be able to place conditional statements inside of the <code>True</code> branch as well, or really anywhere. As it turns out, that&rsquo;s exactly correct. We call this <strong>nesting</strong>, and it is really quite similar to what we&rsquo;ve already seen in this lab.</p>
<p>Using nested conditional statements, we can really start to rethink the entire structure of our program and greatly simplify the code. Let&rsquo;s take a look at how we can do that with our Rock Paper Scissors game.</p>
<h2 id="nesting-conditional-statements">Nesting Conditional Statements</h2>
<p>In our Rock Paper Scissors game, we are really checking the value of two different variables, <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code>. In all of our previous attempts, we built complex Boolean expressions that checked the values of both variables in the same expression, such as <code>p1 == &quot;rock&quot; and p2 == &quot;scissors&quot;</code>. What if we simply checked the value of one variable at a time, and then used nested conditional statements in place of the <code>and</code> operator? What would that look like?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of a Rock Paper Scissors game that makes use of nested conditional statements:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/04/nested.svg?classes=border,shadow" alt="Nested Conditionals"></p>
<p>Here, we begin by checking if the value in <code>p1</code> is <code>&quot;rock&quot;</code>. If it is, then we&rsquo;ll go to the <code>True</code> branch, and start checking the values of <code>p2</code>. If <code>p2</code> is also <code>&quot;rock&quot;</code>, then we know we have a tie and we can output that result. If not, we can check to see if it is <code>&quot;paper&quot;</code> or <code>&quot;scissors&quot;</code>, and output the appropriate result. If none of those are found, then we have to output an error.</p>
<p>In the <code>False</code> branch of the first conditional statement, we know that <code>p1</code> is not <code>&quot;rock&quot;</code>, so we&rsquo;ll have to check if it is <code>&quot;paper&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;scissors&quot;</code>. Inside of each of those conditional statements, we&rsquo;ll also have to check the value of <code>p2</code>, so we&rsquo;ll end up with a significant number of conditional statements in total!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see what such a program would look like in Python:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this example, we have an outer set of chained conditional statements checking the value of <code>p1</code>, and then each of the branches will check the value of <code>p2</code> and determine which output is correct. It is very similar in structure to the chained conditional example on the previous page, just laid out a bit differently. As before, try running this program yourself in either Python or Python Tutor to make sure it works and you understand how it is structured.</p>
<h2 id="removing-duplicate-states">Removing Duplicate States</h2>
<p>Looking at this code, one thing we might quickly notice is that we now have four places that print <code>&quot;error&quot;</code> instead of just one. This is because we now have to check the values of <code>p2</code> in three separate places, and can&rsquo;t simply assume that the final <code>else</code> case in the outermost conditional statement is the only case where an error might be found.</p>
<p>One way we can simplify this code is by including a specific conditional statement just to check for any error situations, and handle those upfront before the rest of the code. So, we can rewrite this code as shown here to accomplish that:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>By confirming that both <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code> only contain either <code>&quot;rock&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;paper&quot;</code>, or <code>&quot;scissors&quot;</code> first, we can then make some pretty handy assumptions later in our code. For example, now the outermost conditional statement only explicitly checks if <code>p1</code> contains <code>&quot;rock&quot;</code> or <code>&quot;paper&quot;</code>, and then the third block is simply an <code>else</code> clause by itself. We can do this because we already know that <code>&quot;scissors&quot;</code> is the only other possible value that can be stored in <code>p1</code>, so we don&rsquo;t have to explicitly check for it. We can make similar changes to the nested conditional statements as well. So, just by adding one complex Boolean expression and conditional statement to our program, we were able to remove 4 that we no longer needed!</p>
<h2 id="further-simplification">Further Simplification</h2>
<p>In fact, we can even take this one step further. Now that we know that both <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code> only contain valid values, we can easily determine if that match has ended in a tie by simply checking if the variables contain the same value. So, with a bit of restructuring, we can simplify our program as shown here:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This code presents a clear, easy to read version of a Rock Paper Scissors program. At the top, we receive input from the users, and then the first conditional statement is used to determine if the input is valid. If not, it will print an error.</p>
<p>If the input is valid, then we can make some assumption about the various possible inputs in our program&rsquo;s logic, which greatly reduced the number of conditional statements. We are also checking for ties at the beginning, so in the <code>False</code> branch of that conditional statement we can also assume that the values in <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code> are different, further reducing the number of items we have to check.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll revisit this example later in this course to show how we can convert the first conditional statement into a loop, which will prompt the user for new input if an invalid input is provided. This will make our program even better and easier for anyone to use.</p>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve seen how we can chain and nest multiple conditional statements in our code, we need to address a very important concept: variable scope.</p>
<p>In programming, <strong>variable scope</strong> refers to the locations in code where variables can be accessed. Contrary to what we may think based on our experience, when we declare a variable in our code, it may not always be available everywhere. Instead, we need to learn the rules that determine where variables are available and why.</p>
<h2 id="many-languages-block-scope">Many Languages: Block Scope</h2>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle warning">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Different Languages</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>The example below demonstrates block scope, which is <strong>NOT</strong> how Python handles scope. We are using Python code so the example is understandable, but Python handles scope differently. See the next section for how Python actually handles scope.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s talk about the most common type of variable scope, which is <strong>block scope</strong>. This type of variable scope is used in many programming languages, such as Java, C#, C/C++, and more. In block scope, variables are only available within the blocks where they are declared, including any other blocks nested within that block. Also, variables can only be accessed by code executed after the variable is initially declared or given a value.</p>
<p>So, what is a <strong>block</strong>? Effectively, each function and conditional statement introduces a new block in the program. In languages such as Java and C/C++, blocks are typically surrounded by curly braces <code>{}</code>. In Python, blocks are indicated by the level of indentation.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following Python code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Global block</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>x <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> int(input(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Enter a number: &#34;</span>))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#75715e"># block A</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> int(input(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Enter a number: &#34;</span>))

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        z <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">10</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#75715e"># block E</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    b <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;?&#34;</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This program contains six different blocks of code:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>Global</code> block, which is all of the code at the top level of the file</li>
<li>Block <code>A</code>, which is all of the code inside of the <code>True</code> branch of the outermost conditional statement.</li>
<li>Block <code>B</code>, the <code>True</code> branch of the inner conditional statement</li>
<li>Block <code>C</code>, the <code>False</code> branch of the inner conditional statement</li>
<li>Block <code>D</code>, the <code>True</code> branch of the first <code>elif</code> clause of the outer conditional statement</li>
<li>Block <code>E</code>, the <code>False</code> branch of the outermost conditional statement</li>
</ul>
<p>Inside of each of those blocks, we see various variables that are declared. For example, the variable <code>x</code> is declared in the <code>Global</code> block. So, with <strong>block scope</strong>, this means that the variable <code>x</code> is accessible anywhere inside of that block, including any blocks nested within it.</p>
<p>Below is a list of all of the variables in this program, annotated with the blocks where that variable is accessible in <strong>block scope</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>x</code> - blocks <code>Global</code>, <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>D</code>, <code>E</code></li>
<li><code>y</code> - blocks <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code></li>
<li><code>z</code> - blocks <code>B</code> and <code>C</code> <em>more on this later</em></li>
<li><code>a</code> - block <code>D</code></li>
<li><code>b</code> - block <code>E</code></li>
</ul>
<p>One thing that is unique about this example is the variable <code>z</code>, which is declared in both block <code>B</code> and block <code>C</code>. What does this mean when we are dealing with block scope? Basically, those variables named <code>z</code> are actually <em>two different variables</em>! Since they cannot be accessed outside of the block that they are declared in, they should really be considered as completely separate entities, even though they are given the same name. This is one of the trickiest concepts when dealing with scope!</p>
<p>So, if this program is using block scope, what variables can be printed at the very end of the program, where the question mark <code>?</code> is found in a <code>print()</code> statement? In this case, only the variable <code>x</code> exists in the <code>Global</code> block&rsquo;s scope, so it is the only variable that we can print at the end of the program.</p>
<p>If we want to print the other variables, we must declare them in the appropriate scope. So, we can update our code as shown here to do that:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>With this change, we can now access all of the variables in the <code>Global</code> scope, so any one of them could be printed at the end of the program. This also has the side effect of making the variable <code>z</code> in both blocks <code>B</code> and <code>C</code> the same variable, since it is now declared at a higher scope.</p>
<h2 id="python-function-scope">Python: Function Scope</h2>
<p>Python, however, uses a different type of variable scope known as <strong>function scope</strong>. In function scope, variables that are declared anywhere in a function are accessible everywhere in that function as soon as they&rsquo;ve been declared or given a value. In Python, the <code>Global</code> scope is treated the same as a function&rsquo;s scope, so variables declared in the Global scope in Python are accessible everywhere. So, once we see a variable in the code while we&rsquo;re executing within a function or in the Global scope, we can access that variable anywhere within the same scope.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Using function scope, any of the variables <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>z</code>, <code>a</code> or <code>b</code> could be placed in the <code>print()</code> statement at the end of the code, and the program <em>could</em> work. However, there is one major caveat that we must keep in mind: we can only print the variable if it has been given a value in the program!</p>
<p>For example, if the user inputs a negative value for <code>x</code>, then the variables <code>y</code>, <code>z</code>, and <code>b</code> are never given a value! We can confirm this by running the program in Python Tutor. As we see here, at the end of the program, only the variables <code>x</code> and <code>a</code> are shown in the list of variables within the <code>Global</code> frame in Python Tutor on the right:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/04/scope.png?classes=border,shadow" alt="Python Tutor"></p>
<p>Because of this, we have to be careful when we write our programs in Python using function scope. It is very easy to find ourselves in situations where our program will work most of the time, since it usually executes the correct blocks of code to populate the variables we need, but there may be situations where that isn&rsquo;t guaranteed.</p>
<p>This is where testing techniques such as <strong>path coverage</strong> are so important. If we have a set of inputs that achieve path coverage, and we are able to show that the variables we need are available at the end of the program in each of those paths, then we know that we can use them.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we can build our programs in Python as if Python used block scope instead of function scope. By assuming that variables are only available in the blocks where they are given a value, we can always ensure that we won&rsquo;t reach a situation where we are trying to access a variable that isn&rsquo;t available. <em>For novice programmers, this is often the simplest option.</em></p>
<p>Dealing with scope is a tricky part of learning to program. Thankfully, in Python, as well as many other languages, we can easily use tools such as Python Tutor and good testing techniques to make sure our programs are well written and won&rsquo;t run into any errors related to variable scope.</p>

</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go through another worked example to see how we can translate a problem statement into a working program. We&rsquo;ll also take a look at how we can test the program to verify that it is working as intended.</p>
<h2 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a short and simple game that can be played by two players:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Three players each guess a positive integer greater than 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span>, and then share them simultaneously. The winner is chosen following this formula:</p>
<ul>
<li>If any two players have chosen the same number, the game is a tie.</li>
<li>If all players have chosen even numbers, or all players have chosen odd numbers, then the smallest number wins.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the largest number wins.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This game has some similarities to Rock Paper Scissors, but the logic is quite a bit different. So, let&rsquo;s work through how we would build this program using conditional statements.</p>
<h2 id="initial-program">Initial Program</h2>
<p>Our first step should be to build a simple program that handles user input. So, we&rsquo;ll create a new Python program that contains three variables to store user input. We&rsquo;ll also use the <code>input()</code> function to read input, and the <code>int()</code> function to convert each input to an integer. Below that, we&rsquo;ll add some print statements for testing. At this point, our program should look similar to this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>p1 <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> int(input(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Enter a positive integer for player 1: &#34;</span>))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>p2 <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> int(input(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Enter a positive integer for player 2: &#34;</span>))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>p3 <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> int(input(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Enter a positive integer for player 3: &#34;</span>))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># debugging statements</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;player 1 chose </span><span style="color:#e6db74">{}</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span>format(p1))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;player 2 chose </span><span style="color:#e6db74">{}</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span>format(p2))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;player 3 chose </span><span style="color:#e6db74">{}</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span>format(p3))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>With this code in place, we&rsquo;ve already created a Python program that we can run and test. So, before moving on, let&rsquo;s run this program at least once to verify that it works correctly. This will help us quickly detect and correct any initial errors in our program, and make it much easer to debug logic errors later on.</p>
<p>So, when we run this program, we should see output similar to this:</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/intro-python/images/04/output1.png?classes=border,shadow" alt="Program Output 1"></p>
<h2 id="checking-for-valid-input">Checking for Valid Input</h2>
<p>Now that we have confirmed our program is working, let&rsquo;s start writing the logic in this program. Deciding which conditional statement to write first is a very important step in designing a program, but it is difficult to learn what works best without lots of practice. If we look at the problem statement above, we see that there are several clear conditions that we&rsquo;ll have to check:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are the numbers all even?
<ul>
<li>If so, which number is smallest?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Are the numbers all odd?
<ul>
<li>If so, which number is smallest?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Are the numbers not all even or odd?
<ul>
<li>If so, which number is largest?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there is one more condition that we should also keep in mind. This one isn&rsquo;t clearly stated in the rules, but implied in the problem statement itself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are all numbers greater than 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span>?</li>
</ul>
<p>So, to write an effective program, we should first make sure that all of the inputs are greater than 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span>. We can do this using a simple conditional statement. We&rsquo;ll also remove our debugging statements, as they are no longer needed:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>p1 <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> int(input(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Enter a positive integer for player 1: &#34;</span>))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>p2 <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> int(input(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Enter a positive integer for player 2: &#34;</span>))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>p3 <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> int(input(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Enter a positive integer for player 3: &#34;</span>))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> p1 <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span> <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> p2 <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span> <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> p3 <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Error&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;All numbers are greater than 0&#34;</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this conditional statement, we are checking to see if any one of the numbers is less than or equal to 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span>. Of course, using some Boolean algebra and De Morgan&rsquo;s law, we can see that this is equivalent to checking if all numbers are not greater than 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span>. Either approach is valid.</p>
<h2 id="checking-for-ties">Checking for Ties</h2>
<p>Once we know we have valid input, the next step in determining a winner is to first determine if there are any ties. For this, we simply need to check if any two players input the same number. Since there are three players, we need to have three different Boolean expressions to accomplish this. In our program, we could add a conditional statement as shown here:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>p1 <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> int(input(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Enter a positive integer for player 1: &#34;</span>))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>p2 <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> int(input(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Enter a positive integer for player 2: &#34;</span>))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>p3 <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> int(input(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Enter a positive integer for player 3: &#34;</span>))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> p1 <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span> <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> p2 <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span> <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> p3 <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Error&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">elif</span> p1 <span style="color:#f92672">==</span> p2 <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> p2 <span style="color:#f92672">==</span> p3 <span style="color:#f92672">or</span> p3 <span style="color:#f92672">==</span> p1:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Tie&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Not a Tie&#34;</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is a pretty simple Boolean expression that will check and see if any possible pair of inputs is equal. We use the <code>or</code> Boolean operator here since any one of those can be true in order for the whole game to be a tie.</p>
<h2 id="all-odds-or-evens">All Odds or Evens</h2>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s tackle whether the inputs are all odds or all evens. If we look at the rules above, this seems to be the next most logical thing we&rsquo;ll need to know in order to determine the winner of the game. Recall that we can determine if a number is even or odd by using the modulo operator <code>%</code> and the number 
<span class="math align-center">$ 2 $</span>. If that result is 
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span>, the number is even. If not, the number is odd.</p>
<p>In code, we can express that in a conditional statement as shown here:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>p1 <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> int(input(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Enter a positive integer for player 1: &#34;</span>))

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Tie&#34;</span>)

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    print(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Numbers are both even and odd&#34;</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Notice that we are using the <code>and</code> Boolean operator in these conditional statements, because we want to be sure that all numbers are either even or odd.</p>
<p>In this example, we&rsquo;re also choosing to use chained conditional statements with the <code>elif</code> keyword instead of nesting the conditionals. This helps clearly show that each outcome is <strong>mutually exclusive</strong> from the other outcomes.</p>
<p>However, we chose to nest the program logic inside of the outermost conditional statement, which checks for valid input. This helps us clearly see the part of the program that is determining who wins the game, and the part of the program that is validating the input. Later on, we&rsquo;ll see how we can rewrite that conditional statement into a loop to prompt the user for new input, so it makes sense for us to keep it separate for now.</p>
<h2 id="determining-the-smallest-number">Determining the Smallest Number</h2>
<p>Once we know if the numbers are either all even or all odd, we know that the winning number is the smallest number of the three inputs. So, how can we determine which number is the smallest? We can use a couple of nested conditional statements!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s handle the situation where all numbers are even first. We know that the smallest number must be smaller than both other numbers. So, we can use a couple of Boolean expressions to check if that is the case for each number:</p>

<p>The last step is to determine the largest number in the case that the numbers are not all even or odd.

We can then place that code <code>False</code> branch of our conditional statement handling the logic of the program:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>There we go! We&rsquo;ve written a complete program that implements the problem statement given above. Did you think it would end up being this complex? Sometimes even a simple problem statement ends up requiring quite a bit of code to implement it fully.</p>
<h2 id="testing---branch-coverage">Testing - Branch Coverage</h2>
<p>The next step is to perform some testing of our program to make sure it is fully working. To do that, we need to come up with a set of inputs that would achieve branch coverage, and possibly even path coverage. However, this time our program is spread across three different sets of conditional statements, so it makes it a bit more difficult to do. So, let&rsquo;s focus on each individual statement separately and see if we can find a set that work for each of them.</p>
<h3 id="top-level-statement">Top-Level Statement</h3>
<p>First, we see the top-level statement has 5 branches to cover, so we need to come up with 5 different sets of inputs in order to achieve branch coverage. We can keep the inputs very small, just to make our testing a bit simpler. Here are the 5 branches to cover, and an input that will reach each one:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invalid input: <code>-1, -1, -1</code></li>
<li>Tie: <code>1, 1, 1</code></li>
<li>All Even: <code>2, 4, 6</code></li>
<li>All Odd: <code>1, 3, 5</code></li>
<li>Mixed: <code>1, 2, 3</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Notice how we are trying to come up with the simplest possible inputs for each branch? That will make it easier to combine these inputs with the ones used in other conditional statements to find an overall set of inputs that will achieve branch coverage for the entire program.</p>
<h3 id="smallest-statements">Smallest Statements</h3>
<p>Next, we can look at the code to find the smallest number. This code is used when the inputs are either all even or all odd. So, we know that either inputs <code>2, 4, 6</code> or <code>1, 3, 5</code> will execute this code.</p>
<p>Within the code itself, we see three branches, depending on which player wins. So, if we start with the input <code>2, 4, 6</code>, we&rsquo;ll see that this will execute the branch where player 1 wins. To execute the other branches, we can simply reorder the inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Player 1 Wins: <code>2, 4, 6</code></li>
<li>Player 2 Wins: <code>4, 2, 6</code></li>
<li>Player 3 Wins: <code>4, 6, 2</code></li>
</ul>
<p>That will achieve branch coverage for the &ldquo;smallest&rdquo; conditional statement, and even overlaps with one of the inputs used in the top-level statement.</p>
<h3 id="largest-statement">Largest Statement</h3>
<p>The same applies to the conditional statement to find the largest number, but in this case we need a mix of even and odd numbers in the input. So, the input <code>1, 2, 3</code> will execute this code, and that input results in player 3 winning. Once again, we can reorder that input a bit to execute all three branches of this code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Player 1 Wins: <code>3, 1, 2</code></li>
<li>Player 2 Wins: <code>1, 3, 2</code></li>
<li>Player 3 Wins: <code>1, 2, 3</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="overall-program">Overall Program</h3>
<p>Therefore, based on our analysis, we can achieve branch coverage across the entire program using 9 different inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invalid input: <code>-1, -1, -1</code></li>
<li>Tie: <code>1, 1, 1</code></li>
<li>All Even:
<ul>
<li>Player 1 Wins: <code>2, 4, 6</code></li>
<li>Player 2 Wins: <code>4, 2, 6</code></li>
<li>Player 3 Wins: <code>4, 6, 2</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All Odd: <code>1, 3, 5</code></li>
<li>Mixed:
<ul>
<li>Player 1 Wins: <code>3, 1, 2</code></li>
<li>Player 2 Wins: <code>1, 3, 2</code></li>
<li>Player 3 Wins: <code>1, 2, 3</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This will execute each branch of all conditional statements in the program at least once.</p>
<h2 id="path-coverage">Path Coverage</h2>
<p>Once we&rsquo;ve achieved branch coverage, we should also quickly look at path coverage: is there any possible pathway through this program that we haven&rsquo;t tested yet? As it turns out, there are two, but they are somewhat difficult to find. Can you spot them? See if you can figure it out before continuing on in this page.</p>
<p>The paths we missed are situations where the numbers are all odd, but a player other than player 1 wins. While we tested all possible branches in the &ldquo;smallest&rdquo; conditional statement, we didn&rsquo;t test it using all odd numbers more than once. So, to truly achieve path coverage, we should add two more inputs to our list above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invalid input: <code>-1, -1, -1</code></li>
<li>Tie: <code>1, 1, 1</code></li>
<li>All Even:
<ul>
<li>Player 1 Wins: <code>2, 4, 6</code></li>
<li>Player 2 Wins: <code>4, 2, 6</code></li>
<li>Player 3 Wins: <code>4, 6, 2</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All Odd:
<ul>
<li>Player 1 Wins: <code>1, 3, 5</code></li>
<li>Player 2 Wins: <code>3, 1, 5</code></li>
<li>Player 3 Wins: <code>3, 5, 1</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mixed:
<ul>
<li>Player 1 Wins: <code>3, 1, 2</code></li>
<li>Player 2 Wins: <code>1, 3, 2</code></li>
<li>Player 3 Wins: <code>1, 2, 3</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, with a total of 11 inputs, we can finally say we&rsquo;ve achieved both branch coverage and path coverage of this program.</p>

<p>One way to express the rules of this game is given below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Three players each guess a positive integer greater than
<span class="math align-center">$ 0 $</span>, and then share them simultaneously. The winner is chosen following this formula:</p>
<ul>
<li>If any two players have chosen the same number, the game is a tie.</li>
<li>Otherwise, compute the sum of the three numbers, and then determine the number of twos, threes, and fours that fit in that number. (Mathematically, perform division and round down.)
<ul>
<li>If player 1 correctly guesses the number of twos in the sum, they win.</li>
<li>If player 2 correctly guesses the number of threes in the sum, they win.</li>
<li>If player 3 correctly guesses the number of fours in the sum, they win.</li>

<p>Write a complete Python program that meets the specification below.</p>
<p>A childcare supervisor has developed a set of rules to determine if children under their care may play indoors or outdoors. Here are the rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>If it is raining, then the children must play indoors since they&rsquo;ll get wet. This rule takes precedence over all other rules.</li>
<li>If the temperature is below 0° C, then the children must play indoors because it is too cold, unless there is snow on the ground. In that case, children may play both indoors and outdoors.</li>
<li>If the temperature is above 40° C, then the children must play indoors because it is too hot, unless the pool is open. In that case, children may play both indoors and outdoors.</li>
<li>If the temperature is between 20° C and 30° C, then the children must play outdoors because it is a nice day.</li>
<li>Otherwise, if no other rules are matched, children may choose to play both indoors and outdoors.</li>
</ol>
<p>Write a program that will help determine if the children may play indoors, outdoors, or both. The program will prompt the user for four inputs in the following order:</p>
<ol>
<li>The temperature as an integer (measured in degrees Celsius).</li>
<li>Whether it is raining: <code>yes</code> or <code>no</code>.</li>
<li>Whether there is snow on the ground: <code>yes</code> or <code>no</code>.</li>
<li>Whether the pool is open: <code>yes</code> or <code>no</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The program should output either <code>indoors</code>, <code>outdoors</code>, or <code>both</code>, depending on the rules described above. Your program must make use of chained and/or nested conditional statements.</p>
<p><em>Hint: after reading input, the <code>yes</code> and <code>no</code> answers can be converted to Boolean values once and stored in Boolean variables. This will simplify the Boolean expressions used in the conditional statements.</em></p>

<p><strong>Variable scope</strong> refers to what parts of the code a particular variable is accessible in. Python uses <strong>function scope</strong>, which means that a variable defined anywhere in a function is available below that definition in any part of the same function.</p>
<p>Other languages use <strong>block scope</strong>, where variables are only available within the block where they are defined.</p>
