In this lab, we covered several major important topics. Let's quickly review them.

## Data Types in Python

* `str` data type stores text (strings). Use `str(expression)` to convert an expression to a string if possible.
* `int` data type stores whole numbers (integers). Use `int(expression)` to convert an expression to an integer if possible.
* `float` data type stored decimal numbers (floating-point). Use `float(expression)` to convert an expression to a floating-point value, if possible. 

## Math Operators in Python

* `+` Addition
* `-` Subtraction
* `*` Multiplication
* `**` Exponentiation (Power)
* `/` Division
* `//` Integer Division
* `%` Modulo (the remainder of division)
