Let's try some simple practice problems. These problems are not graded - they are just for you to practice before doing the real exercises in the lab itself. You can find the answers below each question by clicking the button below each question.

#### 1.1 Reading Code

What is the output that is displayed to the user after running the following Python code:

```python

print("KS", end=" ")
print("66506")
print("KSU!\nGo Cats!")
```

print("*")
print("*")
print("*", end=" ")
print("*", end=" ")
print("*", end=" ")
```
