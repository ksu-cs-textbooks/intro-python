In this lab, we're going to introduce another data type in Python, the **Boolean** data type. Working with Boolean values in programming is a very important skill to learn.

Elsewhere in this course, we've already learned about Boolean values and how they work, so we won't cover that information again here. Feel free to refer to other areas in this course for more background on Booleans, Boolean Logic, Boolean Algebra, and other related topics.

In this lab, we'll learn how to create Boolean values in Python, as well as the various Boolean operators and comparators that can we can use in our code. Then, we'll explore how to use conditional statements to affect the **control flow** of our programs. This allows us to build programs that will perform different tasks based on the input we receive from the user, which is a very key concept in programming. Let's get to it!
