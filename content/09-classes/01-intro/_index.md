We've explored many ways to store data in our programs, from simple variables all the way to complex data structures such as lists and dictionaries. The real world, however, isn't made up of lists and dictionaries, but **objects** that may have several **attributes** that describe the object, as well as several **functions** that the object can perform or that can be performed using the object. So, it would be very useful for us to have a way to represent those concepts directly in our programs. 

For example, what if we want to have a computer program that represents a person? A person can be described by attributes such as their name, age, occupation, and more. Likewise, a person can perform many actions, such as opening a door or changing jobs.

To do this, there is a programming paradigm known as **object-oriented programming** which allows us to represent objects with attributes and the functions it can perform. These objects are created from a blueprint called a **class** and then stored in memory, just like a list or a dictionary.

In this lab, we'll briefly introduce the concepts of classes, objects, and object-oriented programming. We won't give too much detail here since this is an introductory course and Python doesn't require the use of objects, but if you continue on to future programming courses, you'll most likely use a language such as Java or C# that is very focused on object-oriented programming. Let's get started!
