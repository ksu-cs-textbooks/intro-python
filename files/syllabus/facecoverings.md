### Face Coverings

Kansas State University strongly encourages, but does not require, that everyone wear masks while indoors on university property, including while attending in-person classes. For additional information and the latest updates, see [K-Stateâ€™s face covering policy](https://www.k-state.edu/covid-19/guidance/health/face-covering.html).
